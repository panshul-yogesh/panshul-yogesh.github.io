  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>You should create an incident record when you can't complete a request because of a business service failure, or when there is an internal interruption in service.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><b>Permissions</b>: Your user role must have the permission to create an incident.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Run &gt; Incident &gt; Incidents</b>. Service Management displays a list of all incidents.</li>\n<li>Click <b>New</b>. Service Management displays a <b>New Incident</b> form to gather basic information. Service Management doesn't assign an incident ID until you save the incident record.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete the <b>Incident details</b> section.</p>\n<p>This section contains basic information about the incident that helps to accelerate resolution. The description becomes resource information when you search for similar incidents and potential solutions. The more detail that you provide, the easier it's to match new incidents with resolved incidents.</p>\n<p>The <b>Service</b> points to an actual service that's defined by Service Asset and Configuration Management.</p>\n<p>You must set the <b>Business impact</b> and <b>Urgency</b> of the incident. Business impact describes the global effect on the user community. Urgency describes how important the issue is for the end user. Service Management uses the urgency and impact values to calculate the incident resolution priority.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Title</td>\n<td>\n<p>The title is a summary of the issue presented by the end user. If you omit a title, Service Management uses the beginning text from the Description field.</p>\n<p><b>Best Practice:</b> Choose a meaningful, descriptive, and relatively short title. Titles are often the only identification used in selection lists and in other areas to identify components. Service Management displays the title at the top of the form when you edit or display the complete record.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>\n<p>The description captures the details of the incident. You can also capture information that might not fit well elsewhere. For example, if the location and telephone number are different from the contact details, you can record the correct information in this field.</p>\n<p>Service Management may automatically recognize CIs whose details are entered here. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/autocirecog\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/AutoCiRecog\">CI Detection - Automatic recognition of CIs</a>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Impact</b></td>\n<td>\n<p>Impact describes the global effect on the user community. Consider whether the incident affects the entire enterprise, a business unit, or an individual. Valid values are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Enterprise</b></li>\n<li><b>Site or department</b></li>\n<li><b>Multiple users</b></li>\n<li><b>Single user</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The default selection is <b>Single user</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Choose Enterprise if the problem affects the entire organization or a critical business unit. Single user is the lowest impact.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Service</b> </td>\n<td>\n<p>Services are usually related to one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Infrastructure</b>. For example, database or network services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Business services</b>.

If there is an outage or a mission-critical outage, the urgency might be Critical. Valid values are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Total loss of service</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Severe disruption</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slight disruption</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No disruption</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Choose <b>Total loss of service</b> if there is an outage that directly affects the basic infrastructure, such as network services. <b>Slight disruption</b> is the default selection. It indicates the problem doesn't need immediate resolution. The end user can provide guidance for these settings because it's how they perceive the impact and urgency within their organization.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Category</td>\n<td>\n<p>The category describes the type of incident. The default categories are based on best practice recommendations for service-related processes. They reflect how the incident is assigned and help to organize reporting metrics.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">\n<p>At the top of the list of categories Service Management displays smart suggestions, based on the text entered in the <b>Title</b> and the <b>Description</b> fields.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reported by</td>\n<td>Service Management assigns your name (the logged in user) to this field. You can change it. For example, you are opening the incident on behalf of another user and you want their name to appear.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Incident model</td>\n<td>\n<p>A model defines specific steps to be followed for a particular type incident. Choose a model if the new incident fits into an existing profile. For example, the simplest incident model might be for a password reset request.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">\n<ul>\n<li>At the top of the list of models Service Management displays smart suggestions, based on the text entered in the <b>Title</b> and the <b>Description</b> fields.</li>\n<li>When you type a search string in the <b>Incident model</b> field: if the system has 300 or less incident models, the drop-down list displays incident models whose name contains the search string; if the system has more than 300 incident models, the drop-down list displays incident models whose name starts with the search string.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service desk group</td>\n<td>\n<p>A Service desk group is a pool of resources. The Incident Manager can choose a group to own the incident. One or more members of the group can work on the incident resolution.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Owner</td>\n<td>\n<p>The incident owner is responsible for the incident until it's resolved.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Assignment group</td>\n<td>\n<p>A Service desk group is a pool of resources. The Incident Manager can choose a group to own the incident.

When the person who creates an incident can resolve an incident immediately, the incident doesn't have to go through the typical process of assignment, validation, and closure. Immediate resolution might be one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A solution applied to a similar incident</li>\n<li>A published workaround</li>\n<li>A solution documented in a knowledge article</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Service Management uses the text that you provide in the <b>Title</b> and <b>Description</b> fields to launch a knowledge search as soon as you expand the <b>Resolution</b> section. Service Management searches for existing articles or other records that contain matching information. For example, if your description includes the words \"email server down\", Service Management searches for those words throughout the knowledge database. If a match occurs, the <b>Suggested solutions</b> link is displayed. Click the link to see the top three solution candidates. These matches can be any of the following record types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Articles</li>\n<li>User questions</li>\n<li>External knowledge</li>\n<li>Problems</li>\n<li>Changes</li>\n<li>Incidents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to link one of the suggested solutions to this record, hover your mouse over the end of the solution entry to display action buttons.
