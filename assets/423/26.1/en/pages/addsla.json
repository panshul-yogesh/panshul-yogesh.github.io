The service targets are usually measurable goals for service hours and service availability.</p>\n<p>The Service Level Agreement that applies to an incident depends on the organization of the affected customer and the affected service. For example, a network outage that affects internal personnel who connect through a <span class=\"nanospell-typo\">VPN</span> is a critical incident during normal business hours. Similarly, a Service Level Agreement can apply to support requests, such as users who are unable to connect to their email. The Service Level Agreement for such scenarios could require that services are to be restored within a very small amount of time.</p>\n<p>The Service Level Agreement for a service request can describe the fulfillment requirements and acceptable delivery time. For example, a manager requests a laptop for a new employee with the expectation that the laptop will arrive on time. There is a known lead time to obtain the laptop. An emergency service request to repair a laptop assigned to an employee has a critical priority. The impact of lost productivity escalates the resolution urgency.</p>\n<p>The Service Level Agreement for an HR request can also describe fulfillment requirements and acceptable delivery time. For example, an employee makes a request for confirmation of remaining vacation days, with the expectation that the request is processed in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p>A single Service Level Agreement can support more than one organization and more than one service. For example, a network outage can affect the internal <span class=\"nanospell-typo\">VPN</span> used by employees and portals used by customers. There is more than one affected organization and more than one service. Although you can specify more than one service in a Service Level Agreement, don't identify any service in more than one Service Level Agreement.</p>\n<p>An Operational Level Agreement (<span class=\"nanospell-typo\">OLA</span>) defines the interdependent relationships in support of a Service Level Agreement. The <span class=\"nanospell-typo\">OLA</span> describes the responsibilities of each internal support group, including the process and timing of the delivery of their services.</p>\n<p>To create a Service Level Agreement or Operational Level Agreement record:</p>\n<ol style=\"padding-left: 0px;\"><li style=\"--number-width: 10px; --number-spacing: 24px; margin-left: 36px; position: relative;\">\n<p>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Plan &gt; Service Level</b>.</p>\n</li><li style=\"--number-width: 13px; --number-spacing: 24px; margin-left: 36px; position: relative;\">\n<p>Select the type of agreement record you want to create:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 0px;\"><li style=\"margin-left: 40px; position: relative;\">\n<p>Service Agreements</p>\n</li><li style=\"margin-left: 40px; position: relative;\">\n<p>Support Agreements</p>\n</li><li style=\"margin-left: 40px; position: relative;\">\n<p>Human Resources Agreements</p>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li style=\"--number-width: 13px; --number-spacing: 24px; margin-left: 36px; position: relative;\">\n<p>Click <a class=\"image\" href=\"\"> <img alt=\"NewIcon.png\" data-file-height=\"18\" data-file-width=\"17\" src=\"../../../images/NewIcon_7074e789.png\" style=\"width: 17px; height: 18px;\"/> </a> <b>New</b>.
