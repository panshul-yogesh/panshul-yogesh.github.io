Cloud-native Kubernetes platforms make the provisioning and management of Kubernetes much easier. With the cloud-native Kubernetes, the suite can serve customers in a secure, resilient, and simple way.</p>\n<p>On Azure, the cloud-native Kubernetes solution is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reference_architecture\">Reference architecture</h2>\n<p>The following reference architecture provides an overview of the process of deploying the suite on AKS.<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/a/a0/azure-aks-architecture-21.05.png\" title=\"/file/images/a/a0/azure-aks-architecture-21.05.png\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-file-height=\"1176\" data-file-width=\"1773\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/a/a0/azure-aks-architecture-21.05.png\" height=\"1176\" src=\"../../../images/azure-aks-architecture-21.05_6acfbce4.png\" width=\"1773\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benefits_of_using_AKS\">Benefits of using AKS</h3>\n<p>AKS provides the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are no more control plane nodes. The cluster has a guaranteed SLA provided by Azure at a lower cost.</li>\n<li>Managed worker nodes require a lower operational cost of cluster management.</li>\n<li>Cloud-native services are leveraged as much as possible to ease the management experience and reduce operational cost\n\t<ul>\n<li>Azure Container Registry (ACR) is used as container image storage;</li>\n<li>Azure NetApp Files/Azure Files and Azure Disks are used as persistent storage for the suite product.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Components\">Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SMA</b>: the suite product shipped and running in the form of containers and managed by Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><b>Kubernetes</b>: open-source software that allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.</li>\n<li><b>Bastion node</b>: a node that sits in a public subnet. It's used to connect to resources in a private subnet (such as Kubernetes, databases, and storage) to perform tasks such as deployment, persistent volume setup, database setup, upgrade, and troubleshooting.</li>\n<li><b>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</b>: a fully managed service provided by Azure. Once provisioned, the service is ready to work as a Kubernetes platform for you.</li>\n<li><b>Azure NetApp Files (ANF)</b>: a managed NFS service that stores data such as search engine storage, attachments, certificates, and logs used by containerized applications in Kubernetes. The storage is called Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><b>Azure Files Premium and Azure Disks</b>: as an alternative to ANF, <strong>Azure Files Premium</strong> is a managed Server Message Block (SMB) service that stores data attachments, certificates, and logs used by containerized applications in Kubernetes; <strong>Azure Disks </strong>offers high-performance and highly durable block storage for search engine and RabbitMQ. The storage is called Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><b>Database</b> <b>(self-hosted)</b>: stores transactional data and metadata used by containerized applications in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><b>Azure Container Registry (ACR)</b>: a managed Docker registry service that's secure, scalable, and reliable. The suite applications are shipped as container images, which are stored in an ACR.</li>\n<li><b>Load Balancer</b>: used to route traffic from external to internal applications deployed on Kubernetes. Load balancers triggered from the Kubernetes service are able to discover the backend worker node change and always fit into the latest status of the worker node pool.</li>\n<li><b>Application Gateway</b>: used to route traffic from external to internal applications deployed on Kubernetes; meanwhile, it comes with layer 7 load balancing features like SSL offloading.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inter-communication_between_components\">Inter-communication between components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Kubernetes cluster, databases, and storage are kept in a private subnet, while other components such as the load balancer and bastion node are in a public subnet. For information about why public and private subnets are separated, see the \"Architecture design considerations\" section below.</li>\n<li>The load balancer works as the entrance of external traffic. It's usually bound with the site's SMA URL (for example <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://serviceportal.microfocus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"1\">https://serviceportal.microfocus.com</a>). Once end users open the URL in their browsers or mobile apps, after DNS resolution, the load balancer routes traffic from external applications to applications in the private subnet.</li>\n<li>DevOps engineers connect to the bastion node in a public subnet and then jump to the private network for cluster management. The bastion node in this scenario works as a Kubernetes client, database client, or NFS client for operation purposes.</li>\n<li>The applications reside inside the Kubernetes cluster in the private subnet. It uses ANF/Azure Files as its Persistent Volume and self-built database as its database, which are also in the private subnet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Architecture_design_considerations\">Architecture design considerations</h3>\n<h4 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Security\">Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>By separating the public and private subnets, the network infrastructure is able to provide:\n\t<ul>\n<li>An additional layer of security.</li>\n<li>Independent routing tables configured for every private subnet to control the flow of traffic within and outside the Azure VNet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All OMT and suite components are located in the private subnet. NO direct Internet access is allowed.</li>\n<li>Employee Self-Service (ESS) users and IT agents can only connect to the specified ports (for example: 443) for business purposes. A typical traffic path is:<br/>\n<b>End user/IT agent &lt;-&gt; Load balancer (public subnet) &lt;-&gt; AKS worker nodes (private subnet)</b></li>\n<li>DevOps engineers can connect to the bastion node in a public subnet and then jump to the private network for cluster management. Only a limited number of users can access the bastion node. A typical traffic path is:<br/>\n<b>DevOps engineer &lt;-&gt; Bastion node (public subnet) &lt;-&gt; AKS cluster or NFS or DB (private subnet)</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Availability\">Availability</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The control plane nodes and worker nodes are managed by AKS with a target SLA.</li>\n<li>An Azure Application Gateway and load balancer distribute the traffic across different worker nodes.</li>\n<li>Azure NetApp Files/Azure Files &amp; Azure Disks provide storage access for different worker nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\">[Optional] Additional load balancer in front of SMAX</h4>\n<p lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\">According to your organization's network/security requirements, you may need to setup an additional load balancer in front of Service Management.<br/>\nPlease enable websocket on the additional load balancer if you have installed one.</p>\n<div class=\"transcontent stn-end--reference_architecture\"> </div>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personas\">Personas</h2>\n<p>The installation process in a production environment involves different roles in your organization.
