  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>After you update the tags on an AWS or Azure cost reporting integration, and then manually start billing data collection on more than one integration of the same provider type, collection fails on all but the first integration of that provider type. This issue occurs when the integrations are on the same tenant.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This issue occurs because billing data collection can't occur concurrently on integrations with the same cloud provider on the same tenant after tags are updated.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Wait for the first billing data collection to complete successfully. Then, run collection on all the remaining integrations (you can do this concurrently). If you don't run collection on all the remaining integrations, data for these integrations won't be displayed in cloud cost reports.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
