For example, if you're upgrading to version 25.1, keep backups of versions 24.4 and 24.3. You can delete the backup of version 24.3 only after you've successfully upgraded to 25.1.</p>\n<p>For information on the backup procedure, see the <strong>Backup and Restore</strong> section under the <strong>Administer</strong> topic for the products and versions applicable to your deployment.</p>\n</div>",
