Using title case means that you capitalize the first letter for all words, except helper words like ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘by’, ‘for’, 'to', 'from', etc. Examples: Reboot Host, Check the Log Files</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use camel case for inputs, outputs, results, flow variables. Camel case occurs when the first letter is in lower case, and subsequent first letters of words contained in the name are upper case, with no spaces within the name.<br/>\n\tExample: <code>serverName</code></li>\n<li>Use lower case for responses. Examples: success, failure, has more, and no more</li>\n<li>Use lower case with dashes for content pack names or project names.<br/>\n\tExample: <code>oo-linux-remediation-cp.jar</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Content_packs/projects\">Content packs/projects</h4>\n<p>Naming of multiple content packs must be consistent as follows:</p>\n<p>oo<code>-domain | use case | cp-&lt;version&gt;.jar</code></p>\n<p>Examples: <code>oo-microsoft-office-365-cp-2.2.3.jar, oo-sap-provisioning-cp-3.1.1</code></p>\n<p>In Operations Orchestration (OO) the Content Packs are independent of the OO platform (Central, Studio, Workflow Designer, RAS). </p>\n<h4 id=\"Folders\">Folders</h4>\n<p>Naming must be consistent between multiple folders. The names of the folders can be a maximum of 128 characters long, and aren't case sensitive. Using the OO common folder names as much as possible. In this way, the folders are aligned to a common naming and as a result, the operations/flows groups will be more visible.</p>\n<p>The OO common folder names are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Community” for content developed by and for Community</li>\n<li>“Deprecated” for content that was deprecated according to the deprecation policies</li>\n<li>“Integrations” for content specific per integration product</li>\n<li>“Samples” for flows that show how operations and flows can realize simple use cases</li>\n<li>“Utilities” for reusable flows and operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>\nThe following directory structure reflects this nomenclature. Flows in the Utilities folder are also used in other flows, such as “Create Server Profile” and “Update Firmware for Server Profile”. The common Utility flows also create JSON objects.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/66/Content_Authoring_BP_1.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/6/66/Content_Authoring_BP_1.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 1.jpg\" height=\"140\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_1_f1e6582d.jpeg\" width=\"280\"/> </a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Flows,_operations,_and_steps\">Flows, operations, and steps</h4>\n<p>Naming must be consistent between multiple content entities. The names of the flows can be a maximum of 128 characters long, and are not case-sensitive.</p>\n<p>Use &lt;Verb&gt; &lt;Noun&gt; name format for flow and operation names. Also, where possible, use Create, Read, Update, Delete, or another group as common verbs with Get, and Set for &lt;Verb&gt;. When adding operations or flows to an existing integration, use the existing naming for &lt;Verb&gt;. This will ensure consistency with the out-of-the-box flows and operation names. Examples: Create Snapshot, Get Image Details</p>\n<p>It is recommended to rename steps to match the actual action. When using such content in specific flows, its a good practice to rename the step with the name of the actual action that is performed. This can enhance the clarity of the flow.</p>\n<p>Example: the following picture shows that a step named “Is Status Code 200?” is more intuitive than “String Equals”.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/f/f4/Content_Authoring_BP_2.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/f/f4/Content_Authoring_BP_2.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 2.jpg\" height=\"297\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_2_ba6778e0.jpeg\" width=\"539\"/> </a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Inputs_and_outputs\">Inputs and outputs</h4>\n<p>Input and output names must be aligned with common names. For inputs, its recommended that you use common prefixes/suffixes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>host</li>\n<li>username</li>\n<li>password</li>\n<li>port</li>\n<li>timeout</li>\n<li>protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its preferable to add a prefix with the integration product name or acronym such as:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;product&gt;Host, &lt;product&gt;Username, &lt;product&gt;Password</code></p>\n<p>Examples: <code>omiHost</code>, <code>omiUsername</code>, <code>omiPassword</code></p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/61/Content_Authoring_BP_3.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/6/61/Content_Authoring_BP_3.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 3.jpg\" height=\"214\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_3_ec03054c.jpeg\" width=\"351\"/> </a></p>\n<p>The common outputs are: <code>returnResult</code>, <code>returnCode</code>, <code>exception</code>, and <code>FailureMessage</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>returnResult</code> is the primary result of an operation.</p>\n<p>The <code>returnCode</code> is an internal code: 0 for success, –1 for failure. A <code>returnCode</code> is used to determine the response of a step.</p>\n<p>The exception is the exception stack trace, which is mainly used for debugging the root cause in case of failures.</p>\n<p>The FailureMessage is the error message that is used to propagate exception messages between steps and flows. This output name starts with uppercase ‘F’ because OO Studio automatically makes it uppercase by default when a flow is created.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Configuration_items\">Configuration items</h4>\n<p>The following format is recommended for configuration item names:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;Configuration item prefix&gt;_&lt;Project name&gt;_&lt;Type&gt;</code></p>\n<p>The Configuration item prefix consists of the category initials. For example, SL for Selection Lists, SA for System Accounts, and so on.</p>\n<p>The Project name is simply the project to which the configuration item belongs.</p>\n<p>The Type is the configuration item type, such as: selection lists, system accounts, system properties and so on.</p>\n<p>Using the recommended format enables you to better differentiate the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A flow variable from a configuration item.</li>\n<li>Configuration items by their categories. The prefix helps to easily distinguish between a selection list and system account</li>\n<li>Configuration items by the project name. Example: a selection list that belongs to REST Project or to another project</li>\n<li>Configuration items by their type. Example: the system property that contains the URL from that containing the proxy host</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In OO, the configuration items can be structured in folders. This way, working with too long names will be avoided.</p>\n<p>In the following tree structure, you can see examples of the recommended format for configuration items names:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/5/5d/Content_Authoring_BP_4.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/5/5d/Content_Authoring_BP_4.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 4.jpg\" border=\"1\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/5/5d/Content_Authoring_BP_4.jpg\" height=\"294\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_4_e600fdac.jpeg\" style=\"width:290px;height:294px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:1px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"290\"/> </a></p>\n<h4 id=\"Acronyms\">Acronyms</h4>\n<p>The following recommendations apply for well-known abbreviations such as: ID, URL, HTML, and HTTP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use uppercase acronyms rather than Camel case for folder, flow, or operation names.<br/>\n\tExample: HTTP Client</li>\n<li>Use Camel case for inputs and outputs, such as: httpUrl</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Plural_versus_singular\">Plural versus singular</h4>\n<p>Use plurals for folder names.<br/>\nExamples: Servers, Databases, Operating Systems, Images</p>\n<p>Use singular for flows and operations that interact with a single resource, such as getting details on a device.<br/>\nExamples: Get Server Details, Run Script on Server</p>\n<h4 id=\"Legal_naming\">Legal naming</h4>\n<p>Following are the valid characters for naming folders, operations, flows, and configuration items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alphanumeric characters</li>\n<li>Spaces</li>\n<li>Curly, round and square brackets and full width brackets</li>\n<li>Underscore, full width underscore</li>\n<li>Hyphen, full width hyphen</li>\n<li>Dot, full width katakana dot, full stop, ideographic half width stop, half-width katakana middle dot, ideographic full stop, katakana middle dot, middle dot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following strings are reserved names and should not be included in flow names, configuration item names, and folder names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>., .attic, .section, .section.xml, .xml, .properties</li>\n<li>CON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK, NUL, COM1, …, COM9, LPT1, …, COM9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional naming conventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flow names, configuration item names, and folder names cannot contain the sequence “..”</li>\n<li>Flow names, configuration item names, and folder names cannot end with “.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Folder_structure\">Folder structure</h2>\n<p>This section describes how to organize content within folders to create a consistent folder structure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Content_structuring\">Content structuring</h3>\n<p>Make sure that the folder structure is well-defined and consistent between projects, so that other authors will be able to locate your flows, operations, and utilities. Its a best practice to organize the content according to functionality/use case/product:</p>\n<p><b>/Library/&lt;Company | Publisher&gt;/&lt;Domain&gt;/ [Area]/&lt;Use Case | Project&gt;/ [version]</b></p>\n<p><i>Company | Publisher</i> - Having a common top-level folder is advantageous because it clearly separates your own developed content from that of OO and also makes it easier to set permissions.</p>\n<p><i>Domain</i> - The domain is typically tied to larger groups within the organization, as well as the logical separation by technologies.</p>\n<p>Examples: Remediation, Incident Management, Cloud, Virtualization</p>\n<p><i>Area</i> (optional) – Depending on the number of flows and size of your organization, this can be beneficial in that it creates an extra layer based upon either a technical or functional area.</p>\n<p>Example: Linux</p>\n<p><i>Use Case / Project</i> - This level offers a variety of uses, much of which depends on the type and pace of development of OO flows.</p>\n<p>Example: Restart Server</p>\n<p><i>Version (optional)</i> - Useful for when you must run several versions of the same flow at the same time.</p>\n<p>Examples: <code>Library/MyCompany/Remediation/v1.0/Linux/Restart Server Library/MyCompany/Remediation/v1.1/Linux/Restart Server</code></p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/5/54/Content_Authoring_BP_5.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/5/54/Content_Authoring_BP_5.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 5.jpg\" height=\"149\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_5_9b7efd09.jpeg\" width=\"259\"/> </a></p>\n<p>Its recommended that you use the subversioning capabilities of Studio for multiple versions of the same flow. For more details, refer to “Working with Source Control in OO Studio” in the Studio documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Handling_multiple_integration_product_versions\">Handling multiple integration product versions</h3>\n<p>The folder structure of the integrations must be kept small. When you create integrations with many products for the same vendor, consider organizing the flows and operations in a folder structure containing the official vendor and official product names (or broadly used acronyms such as ALM, QC):</p>\n<p><b>../Integrations/Vendor/Product/ [ProductVersion]</b></p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><code>…/Integrations/Micro Focus/OperationManager i/1.0</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"Create_operations_or_flows?\">Create operations or flows?</h2>\n<p>For basic operations, such as CRUD, its recommended that you create operations rather than flows. Also, developing operations is a good choice when you need to support multiple product versions, or hide complex API in atomic operations. Also, programming features such as refactoring provided by different IDEs (such as Eclipse and IntelliJ) helps you to speed up the development and maintenance time. For more details regarding the development of operations, please read The <i>OO SDK - Getting Started</i> tutorial.</p>\n<p>In the following example, the “Wait for task” flow has a large number of steps; in such situations, you don’t want to have busy wait loops in flows as it makes triaging results very difficult. Writing a new “Wait” operation allows for smaller granularity checking, without creating hundreds of tracked results in the OO run logs.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/9/99/Content_Authoring_BP_6.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/9/99/Content_Authoring_BP_6.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 6.jpg\" height=\"366\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_6_76c44469.jpeg\" width=\"529\"/> </a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, creating new operations involves development and test time, while flows can use out-of-the-box operations that have been already tested. To avoid these additional resource requirements, its a best practice to create common and modular code that can be reused.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Descriptions\">Descriptions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Operations_and_flows\">Operations and flows</h3>\n<p>The operations/flows must have clear and consistent descriptions. These descriptions should include the following sections:</p>\n<p><i>Summary</i> is a short description of the operation/flow functionality. It should contain enough information to understand the use case.</p>\n<p>For <i>Inputs</i>, the following items are required for each input whenever the information is applicable and available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Description</li>\n<li>Format</li>\n<li>Default Values</li>\n<li>Valid Values</li>\n<li>Examples</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Results, the following items are required for each:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Description</li>\n<li>Format</li>\n<li>Examples</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Responses section contains the description of each response. <i>Notes</i> (optional) is a custom note section that contain prerequisites, some limitations, or other information deemed useful for the user. <i>Keywords</i> (optional) is a section to help the flow/operation to be found in searches.</p>\n<p>Its recommended that all inputs and outputs are documented in the description, and that they are listed in the same order in which they appear in the Inputs tab. The following items must be enclosed in double quotation marks when used in a sentence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inputs</li>\n<li>Responses or results</li>\n<li>Examples and values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: You must specify a value for the “proxyHost” input. Following is an example of a long description spread across multiple lines:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/c/ce/Content_Authoring_BP_6_A.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/c/ce/Content_Authoring_BP_6_A.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 6 A.jpg\" height=\"118\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_6_A_ead8b664.jpeg\" width=\"808\"/> </a></p>\n<p>The accepted and recommended HTML tags inside the descriptions are:</p>\n<p><code>a, b, blockquote, br, cite, code, dd, dl, dt, em, i, li, ol, p, pre, q, small, span, strike, strong, sub, sup, u, ul </code>and appropriate attributes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Folders_2\">Folders</h3>\n<p>Folder descriptions can be added by right-clicking on a folder and then selecting Properties, as shown in the following image:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/d/d0/Content_Authoring_BP_7.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/d/d0/Content_Authoring_BP_7.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 7.jpg\" height=\"274\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_7_f57dc998.jpeg\" width=\"353\"/> </a></p>\n<p>Add general information about the integration such as versions supported, API, deployment requirements and third party libraries at folder level.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>The content in this folder integrates with VMware vSphere vCenter and ESX(i).</p>\n<p>Supported versions: VMware vSphere 5.1, 5.5 Deployment requirements: Windows or Linux RAS Interfaces / APIs: SOAP Third party libraries: VI Java API 5.1</p>\n<h3 id=\"Additional_description_recommendations\">Additional description recommendations</h3>\n<p>In Descriptions, use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formulations with second person singular instead of third person neutral.<br/>\n\tExample:<br/>\n\tIf you do not specify a value for this input, the operation uses the default value.<br/>\n\tInstead of:<br/>\n\tIf a value for this input is not specified, the operation uses the default value.</li>\n<li>The same syntax for section headings everywhere in the description.<br/>\n\tExample: use “Examples” not “e.g.” or “ex”.</li>\n<li>The values from \"Default Values\", \"Valid Values\", \"Format \", \"Examples\" that contain only a punctuation mark should be between apostrophes.<br/>\n\tExample: Default Value: ‘,’</li>\n<li>Often the summary contains all relevant keywords. But if its not the case, add a line in the end of the description with keywords. This is particularly helpful for shared and reusable content.<br/>\n\tExample: incident management</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Date_and_time,_numbers_and_units\">Date and time, numbers and units</h2>\n<p>The representation of Date and Time, Numbers and Units must be consistent.</p>\n<p>When integrating with a certain product consider using the date and time specific to the integration product. If you report the details of the events from a system, then the expectation is to have the date in the same format. If there is a need for conversion, use the Date and Time content.</p>\n<p>Its preferable that you use the most common and specific units. Asking the user to provide a timeout in milliseconds or a disk size in kilobytes simply creates extra calculations.</p>\n<p>Examples: Prefer seconds over milliseconds, base 10 (MegaBytes) over base 2 (Mebibyte).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Next_topics\">Next topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/flowauthoring\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/FlowAuthoring\">Flow Authoring</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/operations\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/Operations\">Operations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/scriptlets\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/Scriptlets\">Scriptlets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/contentpackversioning\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/ContentPackVersioning\">Content pack versioning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/deprecation\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/Deprecation\">Deprecation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
