In order for the schema to be updated and data collection to continue to work correctly, data collection must have successfully completed at least twice in 23.4.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Please contact the support team at <a href=\"https://www.microfocus.com/support-and-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"1\" title=\"Support and services\">Support and services</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
