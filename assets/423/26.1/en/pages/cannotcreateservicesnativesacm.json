This is no longer possible with the Native SACM solution since the reconciliation engine in UD/UCMDB prevents creating several services with the same name. </p>\n<h2>Workaround</h2>\n<p>In case it's required to create several services with the same name, we recommend that you deactivate the identification rule (change it to \"No identification\") for the Business and Infrastructure Service CI types in UCMDB. <br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ee1f4304cfcb6.96642005.png\" title=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ee1f4304cfcb6.96642005.png\"> <img alt=\"pn_image_5ee1f4304cfcb6\" border=\"0\" file=\"TSIDrule.png\" height=\"456\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/pn_image_5ee1f4304cfcb6.96642005_136cf4da.png\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
