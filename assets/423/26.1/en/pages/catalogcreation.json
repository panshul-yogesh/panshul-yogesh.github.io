For example, a category named <b>Email and collaboration</b> might contain services such as <b>Lotus email</b> or <b>Exchange email</b>, which in turn might include offerings such as “Create a new Public distribution list”, “Change public distribution list owner”, and “Increase mailbox quota”.</p>\n<p>Separating catalog offerings into services enables service owners to maintain their respective catalog areas, that is, to have the tools and permissions to create and update offerings related to the services they own. A service owner is the organizational persona in charge of maintaining a service, providing support for that service, and fulfilling service requests against this service. It would stand to reason that this person would be able to define and edit the service and support offerings related to the service. The service owner should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the offerings and how they appear to end users in the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span>.</li>\n<li>Describe the purpose of the offerings and how to use them. The names and descriptions of the offerings are also used for search matching, so the service owner should be able to include keywords in the descriptions that match what end users search for when looking for this offering.</li>\n<li>Specify the audience for the offerings, that is, which end users would be able to see and request the offering in the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span> (for example, whether or not the offering is specific to a certain location).</li>\n<li>Define a task plan for fulfilling the offering. For example, a local IT help desk manager responsible for distribution and maintenance of personal computers and related equipment would be able to define the process for issuing a laptop for a new employee. The tasks may include checking the stock, ordering a new laptop if none is found in stock, installing the company’s OS image on the laptop, and so on.</li>\n<li>Define a form for the offering.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these activities require the person creating and editing the offering to be very familiar with how the service operates.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Create_a_Catalog_Editor_role\">Create a Catalog Editor role</h2>\n<p>As a prerequisite for enabling groups or individuals to edit catalogs or parts of catalogs, these groups or individuals must get permissions to edit catalog entities. To distinguish these users from the more inclusive Catalog Administrator role, it's suggested to create a new Catalog Editor role, as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the main menu, select <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People &gt; Roles</b>.</li>\n<li>Click <a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/7/73/2018.02_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/Icons/PlusIcon.png\" title=\"/file/images/7/73/2018.02_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/Icons/PlusIcon.png\"> <img alt=\"Add icon\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"22\" src=\"../../../images/PlusIcon_8ed60e27.png\" width=\"24\"/> </a><b>Add</b> at the top of the left pane.</li>\n<li>Type <b>Catalog Editor</b> in the <b>New role</b> dialog box.</li>\n<li>Click <b>OK</b>. Service Management confirms that the new role is saved.</li>\n<li>Set the following permissions:</li>\n</ol>\n<table style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Record type</th>\n<th colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Permissions</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Create</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">View</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Update</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Delete</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Admin</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Comments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Actual Service</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asset Model</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Category</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entitlement Rule</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fulfillment Plan</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Record Category</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Location</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Offering</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Definition</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Resources</th>\n<th colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Permissions</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Create</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">View</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Update</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Delete</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Admin</th>\n<th style=\"height: 31px;\">Comments</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Options</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the <b>People</b> tab.</li>\n<li>Select the person to whom you want to assign the new role.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> and scroll to System use definitions section.</li>\n<li>In the <b>Role</b> field, add the new Catalog Editor role that you just created.</li>\n<li>Repeat these steps for any person or group to whom you want to assign catalog editing permissions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Define_service_ownership\">Define service ownership</h2>\n<p>Define an owner and support groups for the relevant service as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Plan &gt; Service Catalog &gt; Catalog</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Locate the relevant category in the left column and then the service for which you want to assign an owner in the middle column.</li>\n<li>Click the service definition title to view its details and edit it.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Overview section, click <a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/c/c1/2018.08_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/Icons/EnumerationIcon.png\" title=\"/file/images/c/c1/2018.08_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/Icons/EnumerationIcon.png\"> <img alt=\"EnumerationIcon.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"10\" src=\"../../../images/EnumerationIcon_5acaeb74.png\" width=\"13\"/> </a> next to the Owner field and select the name of the person who owns the service.</p>\n<p>In addition, in the Details section of the form, you can specify the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level support groups for the service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Studio</b>.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Offering</b> in the drop-down list at the top of the page.</li>\n<li>Click the <b>Processes and Rules</b> tab and select Offering at the top of the tree.

For example, the following rule enables the members of the 3rd level support group to edit the offerings of a specified service:</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><code>Validate ${ current_user.IsPermitted (null, 'Catalog Administrator') || (entity.Service != null &amp;&amp; entity.Service.OwnedByPerson != null &amp;&amp; current_user == entity.Service.OwnedByPerson) || (entity.Service != null &amp;&amp; entity.Service.SupportLevel3Group != null &amp;&amp; is_in_group(current_user.Id, entity.Service.SupportLevel3Group.Id)) } and display You aren't permitted to edit this offering in case of a failure</code></p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Define_category_ownership\">Define category ownership</h2>\n<p>You may be required to delegate the editing of offerings for an entire service catalog category. For example, each category might aggregate the services and offerings of a service provider such as HR, IT or Facilities. To do this, define the Owner field and the Owning Group field on the Category level.</p>\n<p>Enable the delegation of catalog editing to a category owner or category owning group as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Define an owner and support groups for the relevant category:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Plan &gt; Service Catalog &gt; Catalog</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Find the category that you want to update and click the category title.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the category form, find the <b>Owner</b> and <b>Owning group</b> fields and set them to the relevant person or group.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\">\n<p><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span> If you don't see the <b>Owner</b> and <b>Owning group</b> fields, add them to the Full Category form.
