  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>As part of the suite upgrade precheck, the OMT service status check is mainly focused on the API Server, IDM Server, and Vault Service of OMT. The suite version update relies on these services. If the OMT service status check fails, you can't continue with the suite version update.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cause\">Cause</h2>\n<p>Errors that are most likely to occur are related to your database connection pool. All of the three services described above need a database. If the database can't provide enough connections, the services may have errors. When such errors occur, you should see a message that resembles the following one:</p>\n<pre>Could not open JPA EntityManager for transaction; nested exception is javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.GenericJDBCException: Unable to acquire JDBC Connection </pre>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Solution\">Solution</h2>\n<p>Restart the three pods to release database connections. To do this, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run the following command to get the OMT pod names:<br/>\n<b>kubectl get pods -n core</b></li>\n<li>Run the following commands to restart the three pods:<br/>\n<b>kubectl delete pod [cdf-apiserver-×××××××] -n core</b><br/>\n<b>kubectl delete pod [itom-postgresql-default-×××××××] -n core</b><br/>\n<b>kubectl delete pod [suite-db-×××××××] -n core</b></li>\n<li>Wait for a while to allow the pods to restart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
