The case exchange framework enables you to define an external system with which information will be exchanged. The external system has the ability to create and update records in Service Management as well as to relate those records to records in the external system.</p>\n<p>The Case exchange integration for change is used in the Service Manager integration. For a list of operations supported in the Service Manager integration, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/workwithexternalsys#ExternalSystemsOps\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/WorkWithExternalSys\">Supported operations</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><strong>Note</strong>: The last updated time of the External Reference Record (which external systems use to query for changed documents) will only change when one of these documented operations are triggered by an update. If an update is performed that doesn't trigger an operation (for example, if the priority of the record is changed), the update will not be picked up by the external system.</div>\n<h2 id=\"Outgoing_operations_(all_metaphases)\"><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Outgoing_operations_.28all_metaphases.29\">Outgoing operations (all metaphases)</span></h2>\n<p>The following table indicates scenarios that occur when entering or updating a metaphase or phase of the Change workflow, along with the relevant operation from the external system integration.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><b>Scenario</b></th>\n<th><b>Operation</b></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Owning group field changes from a group that doesn't have an external system defined to an external group</td>\n<td>Assign</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Owning group field changes from an external group to a group that doesn't have an external system defined</td>\n<td>Accept</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Completion code changes to <b>Withdrawn</b></td>\n<td>Cancel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A comment or attachment is added to the record</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\">\n<p><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span> An <b>Update</b> operation can't be generated if a <b>Cancel</b> operation was generated previously.
