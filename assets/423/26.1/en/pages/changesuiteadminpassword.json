When the password has expired, you are prompted to change the password at login. Each new password takes effect immediately and will expire in 90 days. This means you are required to change the suite-admin user's password every 90 days. You can also change the password before it expires, using the <b>Change password</b> option available from My Home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Suite Administration as suite-admin: https://&lt;External Access Host&gt;/bo.</li>\n<li>Select <b>My home</b> under the avatar at the top right corner of the screen.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Change password</b> under the avatar at the top right corner of the screen.</li>\n<li>Enter the old password and new password, and then click <b>Submit</b>. A message is displayed, indicating the password has been changed successfully.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Note:</b> If you find yourself unable to log in to the Suite Administration interface immediately after a password change, it's probably because the suite-admin user account is locked out (for example, due to too many invalid login attempts). Wait for 90 minutes so that the user account is unlocked, and then retry.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
