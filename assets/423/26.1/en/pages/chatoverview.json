If there is no such agreement, Service Management then determines if there is a Service Level Agreement (with chat capability enabled) that matches the actual service of the request.</p>\n<p>The following diagram gives a high level outline of the relationship between the various parts of Service Management that make up the chat capability.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-important-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-important-content\"><div>\n<p>In addition to what's displayed in the diagram, there must be a virtual association between a request and the Service Level Agreement (SLA). To achieve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The relevant service (to which the request relates) must be part of the SLA; and</li>\n<li>The relevant service should be the default service in the offering.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"\"> <img alt=\"Chat capability structure\" class=\"z_migration_tba_PDF\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"../../../images/diagChat3_2810a2a0.png\" style=\"width: 688px; height: 223px;\"/> </a></div>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>\n<p>You can also relate a Service Level Agreement to a record, using an offering or business rule.
