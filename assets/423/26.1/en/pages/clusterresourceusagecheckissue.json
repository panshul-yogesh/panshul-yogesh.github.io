  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n<p>As part of the suite upgrade precheck, the cluster resource usage check ensures that your system has no stability issues. If the CPU or memory usage on a worker node in your k8s system reaches 80%, the system may have stability issues. The precheck step therefore returns a warning or error depending on the severity level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warning: if the usage is between 80% and 90% (inclusive)</li>\n<li>Error: if the usage is greater than 90%</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cause\">Cause</h2>\n<p>The resource usage of the worker nodes is out of balance or you need more worker node resources. </p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Solution\">Solution</h2>\n<p>You may fix this issue as follows：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the resource availability of all worker nodes, and balance the resource usage of the worker nodes as needed.</li>\n<li>If resource usage balancing still doesn't work, add an additional temporary worker node. You may delete this node after the upgrade process is complete.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"transcontent stn-begin--relatedTopics\"> </div>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/balanceclusterresourceusage\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/BalanceClusterResourceUsage\">Balance cluster resource usage</a></p>\n<div class=\"transcontent stn-end--relatedTopics\"> </div>\n</div>",
