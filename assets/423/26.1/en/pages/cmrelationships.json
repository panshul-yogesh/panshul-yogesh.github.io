Typically, Service Request Management, Problem Management, and Universal CMDB (UCMDB) interact with Change Management in an end-to-end process.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Service_Request_Management\">Service Request Management</h2>\n<p>You can escalate Service Request interactions to a request for change to Change Management. A Change Coordinator reviews change requests. The Change Coordinator assigns the change to the applicable support group to make it part of the Change Review process, or rejects the change request. Changes rejected for insufficient information return to the Service Request Agent for additional information. Some changes are rejected because the change is no longer valid.</p>\n<p>When a Service Request agent determines that an incident is the result of a change, he can search the Change database to verify that a recent change caused the service disruption. If the change request exists, he can link the two records. If no change request exists, but a change request is to be registered, the Service Request agent can open a new change request. He can also look at any recent changes for the affected configuration item (CI).</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Problem_Management\">Problem Management</h2>\n<p>Problem Management creates resolutions and workarounds that can require a change request. Change Management tracks and implements the Request for Change ( RFC), which permanently changes the infrastructure and prevents future incidents. When the RFC is complete, the Problem Management process reviews the change before the known error record can close.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/cmitil\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/cmITIL\">ITIL and Change Management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/cminputoutput\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/cmInputOutput\">Change input and output</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/emergencychanges\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/EmergencyChanges\">Emergency Changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/cmkpis\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/cmKPIs\">Change Management KPIs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
