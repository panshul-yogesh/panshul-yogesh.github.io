When you configure measurable properties on a resource offering, you create references to the corresponding service component measurable properties. To view the value of a measurable property, see the corresponding service component property in the <b>Properties</b> tab.</p>\n<p>Measurable properties are used by the following out-of-the-box actions to assist in provider and pool selection and in resource accounting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build Resource Provider and Pool List</li>\n<li>Increase Resource Utilization</li>\n<li>Decrease Resource Utilization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you configure any of these actions on a resource offering in the <b>Provider Selection</b> or enabled <b>Resource Accounting</b>, you must also configure the measurable properties for that resource offering in the <b>Measurable Properties</b> panel.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Navigate to</b> or <b>View</b> (the Measurable Properties panel) — In the left pane of the <b>Sequenced Components</b> area, select the tag associated with the component template.
