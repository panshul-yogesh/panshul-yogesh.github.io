  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>Python Executor is a microservice embedded in both RASes from the internal RAS fleet and external RASes, and Workflow Designer, based on a Python web server that's configured to communicate only with the local worker of the component via RESTful web services. This microservice's main purpose is to evaluate the Python based expressions you are using in your CloudSlang flows in the inputs or outputs of each step.</p>\n<p>Operations Orchestration (OO) provides you an option to configure Python Executor and the evaluation method for the Python based expressions. </p>\n<p>To change the evaluation method of the Python expressions, edit the <b>ras-wrapper.conf</b> for the external RAS or<b> designer-wrapper.conf</b> file in <code>&lt;install_directory&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/conf</code> after installing or upgrading each OO component and set one of the following values to the <code>python.expressionsEval</code> parameter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>python-executor</strong>: use the external Python Executor microservice to evaluate an expression. This is the default value.</li>\n<li><strong>python</strong>: use Inter Process Communication between Java and Python.</li>\n<li><strong>jython</strong>: use the legacy Jython implementation to evaluate the expressions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The evaluation method can't be changed for internal RASes and will always be set by default to Python Executor for better performance.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Caution\"><span class=\"autonumber\">Caution</span>: Please note that <strong>python-executor</strong> and <strong>python</strong> evaluation methods use the installed Python 3 distribution embedded in the OO component and support Python 3 compatible expressions.<br/>\nIf you previously used <strong>jython</strong> as the evaluation method for Python based expressions, please note that this supports Python 2 compatible expressions. In case you have functions or syntax in these expressions that aren't forward compatible in Python 3, like the <code>xrange()</code> function for instance, you might notice that the evaluation of such expressions is failing.<br/>\nTo resolve this situation please update the Python based expressions to be Python 3 compatible.<br/>\nUntil this change is done, you can temporarily change the evaluation method back to <strong>jython</strong>. </div>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Caution\"><span class=\"autonumber\">Caution</span>: The <strong>jython </strong>evaluation method is considered legacy and will no longer be improved. It's recommended to keep the default <strong>python-exectuor</strong> method for best performance.</div>\n<p>The Python Executor port has a default value for each worker in the OO components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RAS</strong>: 8002</li>\n<li><strong>Workflow Designer</strong>: 8003</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When installing or upgrading the component, the default values for the Python Executor port will be used, but if you need to change the port number, please follow this procedure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the <code>&lt;install_directory&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/conf</code> and open the <strong>python-executor.properties</strong> configuration file in a text editor.</li>\n<li>Edit the following property and add the new port number:\n\t<pre><code># Python Executor properties file\n# Port used by the Python Executor - localhost access only\nexecutor.port=</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Save the <strong>python-executor.properties</strong> file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
