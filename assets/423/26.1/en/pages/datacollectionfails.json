  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>After upgrading the suite from 2023.05 to 23.4, the AWS data collection fails for a cost reporting integration that existed before upgrade. On the <strong>Cost Reporting Integrations </strong>UI, the elapsed time keeps increasing but the number of collected records does not increase. About more than 12 hours later, the status of data collection moves from <strong>Collecting</strong> to <strong>Failed</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This happens if the data collection was in progress when the suite was upgraded. You can check the start time to know if the collection was started before the suite upgrade. Post upgrade, the showback pod restarts and causes the in-progress collection to go into a failed state as described above.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<h3>Solution 1</h3>\n<p>If you see the state is <strong>Collecting</strong>, cancel and restart the collection.</p>\n<h3>Solution 2</h3>\n<p>If the collection is in a failed state, restart the collection.</p>\n<p>For information on how to add an integration for a cloud cost data provider, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/cgrointegrations\">Cloud cost data providers</a> and <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/integratecloudproviderfinops\">Integrate with cloud platforms for CMP FinOps</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
