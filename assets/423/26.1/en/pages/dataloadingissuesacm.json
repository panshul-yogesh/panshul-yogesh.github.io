  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><div>No CIs are displayed when you load Devices in a Service Management grid and the filter or order contains non-federated fields.</div>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This issue may occur because the data includes old Devices that don't have <code>bitmap</code> or <code>bitposition</code> values, which are part of the primary key of device. When a filter or order contains non-federated fields, the query needs to make a join on the unique key.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Make sure that all Devices have a bitmap and bit position value. To do this, you can run the <strong>updateEmptyBitmapIds function </strong>in the JMX console in UCMDB.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
