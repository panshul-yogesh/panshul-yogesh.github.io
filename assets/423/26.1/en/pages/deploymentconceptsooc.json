Within a cluster, a node can be a control plane node, also called a master node, worker node, or both. The terms control plane node and master node mean the same. The master node is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster. It manages the cluster operations such as scheduling, detecting, and responding to cluster events. The worker nodes run the OO Containerized components.</p>\n<p>To create a deployment plan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide the use case for your deployment.</li>\n<li>Decide the deployment modes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Find_the_use_case_for_your_deployment\">Find the use case for your deployment</h2>\n<p>The OMT platform, based on Kubernetes and container runtime, provides the necessary infrastructure to run OO Containerized. An OMT environment includes one or more master and one or more worker nodes. Find the number of master and worker nodes based on your deployment objectives.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Deployment_size\">Deployment size</h3>\n<p>The deployment sizes are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small</strong>: up to 5 tenants</li>\n<li><strong>Large</strong>: up to 20 tenants</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Deployment_modes\">Deployment modes</h2>\n<p>You can deploy using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Non HA mode:</b> Intended for environments where High Availability (HA) isn't required.</li>\n<li><b>HA mode:</b> Intended for production environments that require HA. An HA setup uses three master nodes and one of the master nodes has a virtual IP address. When that master node becomes unavailable, one of the remaining master nodes gets the virtual IP address. Accessing the services through the external hostname resolves to the virtual IP address, therefore the services are still reachable after a master node is no longer available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Implications_of_deploying_in_Non-HA_mode\">Implications of deploying in Non HA mode</h3>\n<p>A Non HA deployment has several restrictions and limitations that you should know before you choose it as the deployment model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no load balancing, HA, or configurable resiliency for the Vertica node, PostgreSQL node, and Kubernetes node. The Kubernetes node also acts as the master, worker, and optionally hosts the NFS service and embedded PostgreSQL database.</li>\n<li>Horizontal scaling out from this deployment model (moving to another deployment model) isn't supported for additional load, load balancing, or HA.</li>\n<li>If single node PostgreSQL becomes unresponsive, then the application becomes inaccessible.</li>\n<li>It's recommended to take frequent backups to protect from data loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
