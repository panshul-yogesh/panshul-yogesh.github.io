  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>Operations Orchestration (OO) Workflow Designer is a web-based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a standalone product that can be deployed either on a Windows or Linux server.</p>\n<p>It offers an intuitive drag-and-wire capability to design, create, share, and customize flows. The drag-and-wire visual interface enables rapid time-to-value. A visual flow debugger makes it easy to debug flows.</p>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer doesn’t require a connection to Central. All of its repository operations are available offline. If a source control interaction is required, you decide when the interaction occurs. In this manner, remote teams can use various standalone Workflow Designers, and it is even possible to author outside of the office network.</p>\n<p>Flows are authored in the CloudSlang language and run in OO Central.</p>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Web-based UI</b>: OO Workflow Designer provides web access, which minimizes time-to-value and allows for simple management.</li>\n<li><b>Hybrid authoring interface- Textual and graphical</b>: OO Workflow Designer provides a graphical interface on top of the CloudSlang textual language. Every graphical change is immediately reflected in the underlying source code. This source code can be preserved in a GIT repository and is visible from the OO Workflow Designer UI.</li>\n<li><b>Collaboration using Git</b>: OO Workflow Designer allows collaboration using Git. This means that different authors (Central IT, line of business, operator, or application developer) can contribute to the authoring, while they can each work using their preferred tool. This can be either the OO Workflow Designer in which the authoring is graphical or via ATOM with the CloudSlang plugin which allows authoring the source files directly in a textual manner.</li>\n<li><b>Enhanced usability</b>: OO Workflow Designer and CloudSlang provide enhanced usability for authoring flows, with features such as default errors, sensitive system properties, decisions, input bindings, and direct deployment to OO Central.</li>\n<li><b>Remote Debugging: </b>OO Workflow Designer allows the author to connect to a live OO Central Tenant in a public cloud environment and achieve full debugging capabilities for that environment. This enables multiple authors to test their flows in a real environment and control the testing from within the Workflow Designer debugging environment. Flow debugging doesn't affect the content that is deployed on OO Central Tenant and does not require pre-deployment; however, it provides full logging information in OO Central tenant and is protected by entitlement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For instructions to install an on-premise OO Workflow Designer, see<a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/ooworkflowdesigner\"> Install an on-premise OO Workflow Designer</a></li>\n<li>For instructions to create and deploy a content pack, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/designercreatedeploycp\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/DesignerCreateDeployCP\">Create and deploy a content pack</a></li>\n<li>For instructions to author operations, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/designerauthoroperations\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/DesignerAuthorOperations\">Author operations</a></li>\n<li>For instructions to create steps, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createstepsflow\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/CreateStepsFlow\">Create steps in a flow</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
