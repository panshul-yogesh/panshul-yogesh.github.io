  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>When you are running a Dev2Prod catalog data import, a warning that resembles the following is reported:</p>\n<pre><code>Offering-12666(source)   Failed to get the entity link value: Field Name:'ComposedByAssetModel';Field entity link type:'AssetModel';Field values:[{Field='UUID',Value=037add7d-f221-4a2c-ac44-69d6a22067c5}]</code></pre>\n<p>This warning indicates that the offered asset model (field name in Studio: ComposedByAssetModel) with a UUID of 037add7d-f221-4a2c-ac44-69d6a22067c5 defined in Offering 12666 in the source tenant can't be found in the targe tenant. </p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Offered asset model</strong> field is an entity link field. Only the entity link relationship is exported to the package (the asset model record itself isn't exported). As a result, after an import, the asset model record can't be found in the target tenant. </p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span> In this example warning message, the offering UUID isn't provided, and the offering ID (12666) in the source tenant is provided. This is by design: if a field of a catalog record is linked to a category, service definition, offering, fulfillment plan, asset model, or an entitlement rule, when the field value can't be found in the targe tenant, the corresponding warning message doesn't indicate the UUID of the catalog record. </div>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Add the asset model to the <strong>Related asset model</strong> field, which is Many2Many field. This way, the asset model, as a Many2Many field value, will be exported together with the offering. For more information about how Many2Many fields are handled during export, see <a href=\"http://Many2Many%20field%20handling\">Many2Many field handling</a>.</p>\n<p>The following are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the source tenant, open the offering record (offering 12666 in this example).</li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Related asset model</strong> section, click <strong>Add</strong> to add the same asset model defined in the <strong>Offered asset model </strong>field.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Utilities</strong> &gt; <strong>Packages</strong>, open the package from the list, and click <strong>Export</strong>. </li>\n<li>In the target tenant, import the new package.</li>\n<li>Locate the imported offering, and manually remove the asset model from the <strong>Related asset model </strong>section. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
