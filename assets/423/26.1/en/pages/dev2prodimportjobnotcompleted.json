  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>When you attempt to run a Dev2Prod import job, the job fails with the following error: </p>\n<pre><code>The data import failed.\nDetails: An existing Dev2Prod import job is still running. You need to wait until the existing job is completed before you can run a new job. </code></pre>\n<h2>Possible causes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cause 1: An existing import job is still running.</li>\n<li>Cause 2: An existing job was interrupted for some reason (for example, due to a restart of the platform pod) and could not be completed. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<h3>Solution for cause 1</h3>\n<p>Wait until the existing job is completed and then run the new job.</p>\n<h3>Solution for cause 2</h3>\n<p>In this case, the tenant's status gets stuck in <strong>Dev2Prod</strong> state. You need to change the tenant state to Active before you can run the new job. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the Dev2Prod log on the NFS server: &lt;logging-volume&gt;/logs/xservices/platform/itom-xruntime-platform-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx/maas/maas_packageManager.log. If a job was successfully completed, you should be able to see two messages that resemble the following:\n\t<pre><code>Import task with id 5fb33b5f7b66c1a8e3539696 started running \nImport task with id 5fb33b5f7b66c1a8e3539696 completed successfully </code></pre>\n<p><br/>\n\tIf a job was not completed, the second message isn't displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Log in to the PostgreSQL database server for the suite, open the <strong>TenantData_857561481</strong> table in the <strong>xservices_rms</strong> database, and locate the line for the current tenant. </li>\n<li>Change the tenant's <strong>state</strong> value from <strong>Dev2Prod</strong> to <strong>Active</strong>. The following figure shows an example tenant in Dev2Prod state. Note that we recommend using PGADMIN to change the state, because it’s much safer and easier to do this in PGADMIN than with sql statements on the command line.<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/68/SMA_202011_dev2prod_job_still_running.png\" title=\"/file/images/6/68/SMA_202011_dev2prod_job_still_running.png\"> <img alt=\"SMA_202011_dev2prod_job_still_running\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/6/68/SMA_202011_dev2prod_job_still_running.png\" height=\"69\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/SMA_202011_dev2prod_job_still_running_6307c8b7.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 69px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a></li>\n<li>Restart the itom-xruntime-platform and itom-xruntime-platform-offline pods.  </li>\n<li>Rerun the new import job from the Package Manager. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
