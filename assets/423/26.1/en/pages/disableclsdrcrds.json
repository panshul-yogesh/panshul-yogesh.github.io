  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">You can use the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span> feature setting <b>Enable read-only display for closed requests</b> to disable closed records. If enabled, closed requests (those in the <b>Close</b> or <b>Abandon</b> phase) are set to read-only and are displayed to portal users as grayed out. For example, with this feature enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Portal users</b> can't add comments or attachments, nor change the public scope of closed requests.</li>\n<li>Users on the Service Management <b>agent side</b> can still edit closed requests.</li>\n<li>You can still edit closed requests using the REST API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also configure the <b>Restrict/allow editing of fields</b> rule to disable closed records on the <b>agent</b> side of Service Management. Use of this rule isn't restricted to requesting records, and you can also configure the rule so that, for example, some fields are editable in closed records.</p>\n<p>To add and configure the rule:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu_Starter\">Main menu</span>, select <b>Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Studio</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the drop-down at the top of the page, select the <b>Request</b> record type.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>\n<p>This procedure assumes you want the rule to apply to Request record types, but you can apply the rule to other record types as well using the same technique.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <b>Processes and Rules</b> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the left pane, select <b>Request</b> at the top of the tree.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the main panel, in the Rendering forms section:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <b>Add</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <b>“If…Then”</b> rule.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <b>Restrict/allow editing of fields</b> template, and click <b>OK</b>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <b>expression</b> to edit the condition for the rule. Use the following condition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>entity.Active==false</code></p>\n<p>Adding this part to the rule makes it applicable to request records that are inactive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <b>Restrict/allow</b> and select <b>Restrict</b> from the drop-down. Then click <b>OK</b>.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>\n<p>This disables the editing of all fields <b>other than many-to-many relationship fields</b>. Users can still edit many-to-many relationship fields.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save your changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>To be able to move a record to an end phase, you need to add an <strong>Allow </strong>rule for certain fields, such as <strong>Phase Id</strong> or others. Failing to do that will result in errors at record update time. </div></div></div>\n<p>You can add a business rule that allows editing of fields by selecting <b>Allow</b> from the drop-down, and then clicking <b>all fields/specific fields</b> and adding the desired fields.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-caution-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-caution-content\"><div>\n<p>You must take care if you add several business rules using this template. The rules are implemented in the (top to bottom) order listed on the <b>Processes and Rules</b> page for the record type.</p>\n<p>In the following example, the restrict rule will supersede.<br/>\n- You add a business rule that enables editing of a particular field in the <b>Close</b> phase.<br/>\n- While a business rule restricts editing of fields in the <b>Close</b> phase. </p>\n<p>To achieve the desired effect, the restrict rule should be before the enable rule.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enableeditrequests\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/EnableEditRequests\">Edit requests in the Service Portal</a> and <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/renderingrules#RestrictEditing\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/RenderingRules\">Restrict/allow editing of fields</a>.</p>\n</div>",
