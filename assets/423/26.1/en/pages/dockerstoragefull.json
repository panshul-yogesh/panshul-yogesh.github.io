  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>You see a pod in image pull error state; when you run the <strong>kubectl describe pod [pod name]  -n [namespace]</strong> command, you receive an error that resembles the following:</p>\n<pre><code>devmapper: Thin Pool has 157934 free data blocks which is less than minimum required 163840 free data blocks. Create more free space in thin pool or use dm.min_free_space option to change behavior.</code></pre>\n<p>This issue normally happens during an upgrade when the suite system has experienced upgrades for multiple releases, causing the upgrade to fail. It may also happen during the normal operation of the system. </p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>From releases to release, OMT pulls the images from the private registry (NFS) to the worker nodes and control plane nodes to start the containers; however, it doesn't remove unused images (for older releases). This may cause the docker storage to become full and hence an image pull error when the containers try to pull images to the worker nodes or control plane nodes.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Remove unused images by running the following command on each worker node:</p>\n<pre><code>crictl rmi --prune -a</code></pre>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
