Encryption is designed to prevent the exposure and modification of sensitive data, such as passwords, definitions, and so on, in OO Workflow Designer.</p>\n<p>It is important to use well-known, standard algorithms without known vulnerabilities, in order to prevent decryption by unauthorized persons.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>For example, SSL is not used, because of known vulnerabilities in the SSL protocol.</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Static Data</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All saved passwords are protected using well known algorithms and none are left in clear text. For example, the database passwords are encrypted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Data in-transit</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to encrypt the data between components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Disabling the HTTP port</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is recommended to disable the HTTP port, for security reasons, so that the only communication channel will be on TLS and encrypted.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Encryption_administration\">Encryption administration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Default Configuration Set</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Symmetric-key algorithm: AES with key size 128</li>\n<li>Hashing algorithm: SHA1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Advanced Settings</b><br/>\n\tOO Workflow Designer uses the following security algorithm:\n\t<ul>\n<li>Symmetric-key algorithm: AES256</li>\n<li>Hashing algorithm: SHA256</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Digital_certificates\">Digital certificates</h2>\n<p>A digital certificate is an electronic \"passport\" for a person, server, station, and so on.</p>\n<p>To use encryption between a browser and the OO Workflow Designer server, you need to install a digital certificate on the server side.</p>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer uses the Java Keytool utility to manage cryptographic keys and trusted certificates. This utility is included in the OO Workflow Designer installation folder, in <b>&lt;installation dir&gt;/java/bin/keytool</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Certificate Location</b></p>\n<p>Installations of OO Workflow Designer include two files for the management of certificates using Keytool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>&lt;installation dir&gt;/designer/var/security/client.truststore</b>: Contains the list of trusted certificates</li>\n<li><b>&lt;installation dir&gt;/desginer/var/security/key.store</b>: Contains the OO Workflow Designer private certificate (including the private key)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Access Control to KeyStore and TrustStore</b></p>\n<p>It is recommended that the TrustStore and KeyStore are stored with read permissions only for the user that runs the OO Workflow Designer service.</p>\n<p><b>Replacing the OO Workflow Designer Self-signed Certificate</b></p>\n<p>It is recommended to replace the OO Workflow Designer self-signed certificate after a new installation of OO Workflow Designer or if your current certificate has expired.</p>\n<p>Part of the process of replacing the certificate is generating a PKCS12 format certificate, using your CA. Contact your CA for specific details about the certification process or refer to your corporate policy.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
