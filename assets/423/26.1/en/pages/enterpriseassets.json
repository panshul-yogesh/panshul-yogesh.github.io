Through the application of Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), we provide a centralized platform to oversee the end-to-end lifecycle of your enterprise assets. This will optimize resource allocation, minimize downtimes, and extend asset lifespans.</p>\n<p>For each enterprise asset, you can define its <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetsubtypes\" title=\"Enterprise asset subtypes\">Subtype</a> and <strong>Process type</strong> based on specific categories and their lifecycles. Out of the box, there're three process types of enterprise assets, and each has its corresponding workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Full-ownership assets</b> mean the organization or individual has complete ownership and responsibility for the entire lifecycle of the asset. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetwflw#Full_Ownership\" title=\"Full-ownership assets workflow\">Full-ownership assets workflow</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consumable assets</strong> need to be disposed of considering the legal, environmental, or regulatory requirements when they are used up or expired.​ For example, office supplies, fuel, and chemicals. Some consumable assets may have expiration dates, so there is a transition from being in stock to disposal. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetwflw#Consumable\" title=\"Consumable assets workflow\">Consumable assets workflow</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Stationary assets</strong> typically refer to fixed assets that remain in a fixed location and aren't easily moved. For example, buildings, land, conference rooms, and elevators.​ See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetwflw#Stationary\" title=\"Stationary assets workflow\">Stationary assets workflow</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also create an <strong>Asset Model</strong> for the Enterprise asset, and associate an enterprise asset subtype with the model. Then, when creating an enterprise asset, you can specify an enterprise asset model in the Model field. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/assetmodel\" title=\"Asset models\">Asset models</a> for guidance.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-tip-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-tip-content\">If you are using <strong>Enterprise Assets</strong> for the first time, there will be more Service Portal users generating requests related to Enterprise Assets. Ensure that you reevaluate the deployment size based on the potential number of concurrent users. Refer to the deployment sizing documents according to the platform you're using and increase the hardware resources (for example, CPU and memory) accordingly.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetroles\" title=\"Enterprise Asset roles and permissions\">Enterprise Asset roles and permissions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createenterpriseasset\" title=\"Create an enterprise asset\">Create an enterprise asset</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/editenterpriseasset\" title=\"Edit an enterprise asset\">Edit an enterprise asset</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/deleteenterpriseasset\" title=\"Delete an enterprise asset\">Delete an enterprise asset</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enterpriseassetwflw\" title=\"Enterprise assets workflow\">Enterprise assets workflow</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
