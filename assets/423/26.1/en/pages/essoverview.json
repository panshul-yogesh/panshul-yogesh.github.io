Its easy-to-use interface enables users to independently request support, search a self-help knowledge base, and browse a service catalog. Users can even ask their friends for help using an intuitive question and answer (Q&amp;A) interface in which questions are routed to other employees, based on their skills and expertise. The <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span> also enables employees to track support and service requests.</p>\n<p>The portal's sophisticated search capabilities enable users to independently find relevant information. Search results are gathered from multiple sources and can include multimedia-rich articles, user Q&amp;A, relevant services and forms, and targeted support – all displayed in one, user-friendly interface.</p>\n<p>You use Service Management to configure the portal to present valuable information and forms to end users. The catalog, support offerings, and articles are managed in the Service Catalog Management and Knowledge Management modules.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Category_tiles\">Category tiles</h2>\n<p>On the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span>, when a user clicks a category tile, a page is displayed with three tabbed sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Featured (hidden by default) - displays news, recommended &amp; popular offerings, and articles</li>\n<li>Offerings - displays all offerings that belong to the category</li>\n<li>Articles - displays relevant articles that belong to the category</li>\n<li>News - displays relevant news that belong to the category</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The category page also includes an enhanced search drop-down option, allowing the user to search the selected category or all categories.</p>\n<p>For information about how to configure this and other portal settings, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/setfeature\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/SetFeature\">How to configure Service Portal feature settings</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grid_view_of_requests\">Grid view of requests</h2>\n<p>In <span class=\"SAW_VariablesSelf-Service_Portal\">Service Portal</span>, users can click <b>Your Requests</b> to view all of their own requests in tabbed sections: <b>Open</b>, <b>Closed</b>, <b>Following</b>, <b>Public</b>, and customized tabs.</p>\n<p>Defined by the system administrator, the customized tabs display requests based on DSL expressions. A user can click a request to view its details, sort the columns, and filter these requests by specifying ID, keywords in the title, urgency, priority, and so on.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\">\n<p><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span> If a user is neither the \"Requested for\" person nor the \"Requested by\" person of the request, the user isn't authorized to view the request details.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Additionally, a user can also export up to 10,000 requests on the customized tab to an Excel table by clicking the <b>Export to XLS</b> button.
