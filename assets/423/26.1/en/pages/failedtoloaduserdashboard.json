Contact your administrator.</code></pre>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This error occurs because the user has no default dashboard explicitly defined in the <strong>Default dashboard</strong> field either in the user's Person record or in the user's profile, so the system should load the system default dashboard for the user; however, there's more than one system default dashboard found in the system, and hence the error occurs. </p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span> It's impossible to set more than one system default dashboard by using the <strong>Set as system default</strong> button; however, it's possible to do this through a Mass Update or through a REST call. </div>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The tenant admin must cancel unwanted system default dashboards, and make sure that the system has only one system default dashboard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the agent interface as the tenant admin.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Master Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Deshboard Definitions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add the <strong>System default dashboard</strong> field to the grid view if it's not available.</li>\n<li>Cancel unwanted system default dashboards so that the system has only system default dashboards. To cancel an unwanted system default dashboard, open the record and then uncheck the <strong>System default dashboard</strong> check box. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
