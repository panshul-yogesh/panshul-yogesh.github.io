This issue only occurs if you have upgraded to 24.2 from an earlier version.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>24.2 includes a new AWS schema. The schema is upgraded either when a successful data collection occurs or when you access reports. When you delete an integration before the schema is upgraded, data related to this integration may not be cleaned up from the billing table in the database.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>After you upgrade to 24.2, don't delete an AWS cloud cost integration until one of the following has occured:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Successful data collection of any integration end point</li>\n<li>You have accessed reports from the Cost Governance reports page</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event that you have already deleted an integration, please contact the support team at <a href=\"https://www.microfocus.com/support-and-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"1\" title=\"Support and services\">Support and services</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
