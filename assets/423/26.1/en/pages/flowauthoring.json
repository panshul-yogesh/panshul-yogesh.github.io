Each flow should have a single, well-focused purpose, executing only single aspect of the desired functionality. Also, the name of flow must be self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>The benefit of creating such modular flows is that they are easier to create, test, maintain, enhance, and reuse.</p>\n<p>Why it is important to separate more responsibilities into separate flows? Because each responsibility is an axis to change. When the requirements change, that change will be manifest through a change in responsibility among the flows. If a flow has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. This kind of coupling leads to fragile designs that break in unexpected ways when changed.</p>\n<p>Modular flows are easier to test. Breaking a large flow into smaller independent flows means that parts of a complex flow can be tested independently and likely with fewer tests.</p>\n<p>Modular flows have greater cohesion. Smaller flows adapt more readily to new requirements and are more easily stabilized.</p>\n<p>Modular flows can be reused. This “economy” eliminates the duplication of knowledge or logic that has already been implemented.</p>\n<p>Modular flows are easy to understand. Imagine that you have been assigned to fix a bug in the flow shown in Figure A. Now take a look at the flow shown in Figure B. Which flow would you rather work on?</p>\n<p>The following example shows a well-focused flow with a clear purpose.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/8/8b/Content_Authoring_BP_10.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/8/8b/Content_Authoring_BP_10.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 10.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"263\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_10_e9506373.jpeg\" width=\"865\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_step_references\">Use step references</h3>\n<p>A step reference is flow or operation placed in a wrapper and used in other complex flows. Step referencing is a common practice when reusing flows and operations. Step references are advantageous because a wrapper flow can be tailored to specific process and user requirements, thereby reducing the overall amount of flow authoring work.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Keep_Flows_Small\">Keep Flows Small</h3>\n<p>A flow should fit on the canvas with Studio maximized, with a 1:1 view magnification. It is recommended that you employ modular flows. In fact, when you have flows with more than 10 steps, you should consider splitting them into subflows. While large flows with 10 steps or more are allowed, it is a best practice to carefully examine such flows to identify where sequences of steps can be broken down into subflows.</p>\n<p>Small flows are recommended because they are easy to test, easy to debug, easy to maintain, easy to understand for others.</p>\n<p>For example, the following flow epitomizes poor design practices (it has more than 40 steps, spaghetti transitions and the start step is obscure placed).</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/0/0a/Content_Authoring_BP_11.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/0/0a/Content_Authoring_BP_11.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"384\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_11_03646713.jpeg\" width=\"890\"/> </a> <i>Figure A</i></p>\n<p>In Figure B, the steps have been grouped into subflows; the main flow is much improved:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/1/14/Content_Authoring_BP_12.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/1/14/Content_Authoring_BP_12.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"376\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_12_e5c243f3.jpeg\" width=\"533\"/> </a> <i>Figure B</i></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Start_step\">Start step</h3>\n<p>The start step should be located in the upper-left corner of the flow, with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Start step has many responses, each of which leads to another step</li>\n<li>Placing the start step in the upper-left corner would cause excessive visual complexity, such as crossing of transitions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transitions\">Transitions</h3>\n<p><b>Keep Transition Neat and Tidy</b> As much as possible, transition lines should not cross over each other.</p>\n<p>Collapse multiple transitions from one step to another (in same direction) so that a single line represents all of the transitions.</p>\n<p>Place transition labels close to the source/origin step:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/3/3b/Content_Authoring_BP_13.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/3/3b/Content_Authoring_BP_13.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"258\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_13_15860a20.jpeg\" width=\"1024\"/> </a></p>\n<p><b>Keep Transition Lines Out of Step Names</b></p>\n<p>It is helpful for users if you use a well-chosen, meaningful step name. For example, in the following pictures, the diagram on the left is quicker to code, but the example on the right is easier to read and debug.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/64/Content_Authoring_BP_15.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/6/64/Content_Authoring_BP_15.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"303\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_15_8cecb5f4.jpeg\" width=\"974\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Callouts\">Callouts</h3>\n<p>It is helpful to see a well-chosen step name, but sometimes you want to have more information displayed in the flow panel. The OO callouts represents a good way to accomplish this.</p>\n<p>The following example shows how you can use callouts in a flow:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/3/38/Content_Authoring_BP_17.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/3/38/Content_Authoring_BP_17.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_17_7dadd831.jpeg\" width=\"1065\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Layout\">Layout</h3>\n<p>When designing a flow layout, it is a best practice to consider well-known process automation layouts.</p>\n<p>Swimlane (cross-functional) diagrams are process flowcharts that can be expanded to show times (such as when tasks are complete and how long they take) as well as information about who is responsible for what. Swimlane diagrams enable you to identify time traps - which processes take the most time - as well as capacity constraints, and which resources are getting bogged down with work.</p>\n<p>Following is an OO Swimlane flow:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/8/89/Content_Authoring_BP_18.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/8/89/Content_Authoring_BP_18.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 18.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"586\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_18_96bf951e.jpeg\" width=\"943\"/> </a></p>\n<p><b>Note</b></p>\n<p>For more details regarding the customization of the transitions, refer to Customizing Flow Transitions.</p>\n<p>“Z” Layout diagrams progress from left to right and from top to bottom, and are best-suited when transitions (success, failure) to return steps do not cross transitions between regular steps.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/3/39/Content_Authoring_BP_19.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/3/39/Content_Authoring_BP_19.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 19.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"310\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_19_97fec97d.jpeg\" width=\"716\"/> </a></p>\n<p>“2” Layout diagrams progress from left to right and from top to bottom, and are best-suited when there are “central” steps - such as notification or exception handler - in the flow, or to avoid crossing transitions.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/8/8b/Content_Authoring_BP_20.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/8/8b/Content_Authoring_BP_20.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 20.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"760\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_20_fd9746f9.jpeg\" width=\"772\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Icons\">Icons</h3>\n<p>The saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words” applies to the use of icons, which can quickly communicate content and structure, as well as improve readability.</p>\n<p>To achieve quick and easy communication, select relevant icons. For example, use specific, well-known icons to represent resources (such as Servers or Databases). When appropriate and helpful, add annotations to represent different actions (such as Start, Stop, and Check).</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/e/e4/Content_Authoring_BP_18_A.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/e/e4/Content_Authoring_BP_18_A.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 18 A.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"654\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_18_A_aa0adb3c.jpeg\" width=\"1106\"/> </a></p>\n<p>To add annotations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expand the Icons panel in Studio:<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/1/1b/Content_Authoring_BP_19_A.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/1/1b/Content_Authoring_BP_19_A.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 19 A.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"270\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_19_A_5cc0eb65.jpeg\" width=\"202\"/> </a></li>\n<li>Fix it on the screen by clicking on the small pin:<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/1/1a/Content_Authoring_BP_20_A.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/1/1a/Content_Authoring_BP_20_A.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 20 A.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"49\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_20_A_7b67c48b.jpeg\" width=\"196\"/> </a></li>\n<li>Open the Properties of a flow or operation:<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/d/df/Content_Authoring_BP_21.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/d/df/Content_Authoring_BP_21.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 21.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"444\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_21_e895eb62.jpeg\" width=\"671\"/> </a></li>\n<li>Drag the Annotation icon over the original icon:<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/7/7c/Content_Authoring_BP_22.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/7/7c/Content_Authoring_BP_22.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 22.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"66\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_22_86f188c1.jpeg\" width=\"154\"/> </a></li>\n<li>Final icon is ready:<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/7/74/Content_Authoring_BP_23.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/7/74/Content_Authoring_BP_23.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Content Authoring BP 23.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"64\" src=\"../../../images/Content_Authoring_BP_23_4f20c636.jpeg\" width=\"72\"/> </a></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
