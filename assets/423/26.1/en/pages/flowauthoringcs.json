Each flow should have a single, well-focused purpose, executing one single aspect of the desired functionality. Also, the name of flow must be self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>Modular flows are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easier to create</strong>. Separate more responsibilities into separate flows? Because each responsibility is an axis to change. When the requirements change, that change alters the responsibility of the flows. If a flow has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. This kind of coupling leads to fragile designs that break in unexpected ways when changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to test</strong>. Breaking a large flow into smaller independent flows means that parts of a complex flow can be tested independently and likely with fewer tests.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to maintain and enhance.</strong><b> </b>Modular flows have greater cohesion. Smaller flows adapt more readily to new requirements and are more easily stabilized.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to reuse.</strong><b> </b>This “economy” eliminates the duplication of knowledge or logic that has already been implemented.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to understand</strong>. Imagine that you have been assigned to fix a bug in the flow shown in Figure A. Now take a look at the flow shown in Figure B. Which flow would you rather work on?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following example shows a well-focused flow with a clear purpose:</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/3/3f/flowwwwwww.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/3/3f/flowwwwwww.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/3/3f/flowwwwwww.jpg\" height=\"293\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/flowwwwwww_e127f76d.jpeg\" style=\"width:700px;height:293px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"700\"/> </a></p>\n<h3 id=\"Use_step_references\">Use step references</h3>\n<p>A step reference is a flow or operation placed in a wrapper and used in other complex flows. Step referencing is a common practice when reusing flows and operations. Step references are advantageous because a wrapper flow can be tailored to specific process and user requirements, thereby reducing the overall amount of flow authoring work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Keep_Flows_Small\">Keep Flows Small</h3>\n<p>A flow should fit on the canvas with the browser window maximized, with a 1:1 view magnification. It is recommended that you employ modular flows. In fact, when you have flows with more than 10 steps, you should consider splitting them into subflows. While large flows where 10 steps or more are allowed, it is a best practice to carefully examine such flows to identify where sequences of steps can be broken down into subflows.</p>\n<p>Small flows are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>easy to test</li>\n<li>easy to debug</li>\n<li>easy to maintain</li>\n<li>easy to understand for others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the following flow epitomizes poor design practices (it has more than 40 steps, crossed transitions and the start step is obscure placed).</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/9/93/complicatedflow_%282%29.png\" title=\"/file/images/9/93/complicatedflow_%282%29.png\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/9/93/complicatedflow_%282%29.png\" height=\"582\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/complicatedflow_28229_bbcb4692.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 582px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a>  </p>\n<p><i>Figure A</i></p>\n<p>In Figure B, the steps have been grouped into subflows; the main flow is much improved:</p>\n<p><i>Figure B</i></p>\n<p><i><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/4/47/improvedflow.png\" title=\"/file/images/4/47/improvedflow.png\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/4/47/improvedflow.png\" height=\"401\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/improvedflow_b31bc95a.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 401px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a> </i></p>\n<h3 id=\"Start_step\">Start step</h3>\n<p>The start step should be located in the upper-left corner of the flow, with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Start step has many responses, each of which leads to another step.</li>\n<li>Placing the Start step in the upper-left corner would cause excessive visual complexity, such as transition crossing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Transitions\">Transitions</h3>\n<p><b>Keep Transition Neat and Tidy</b></p>\n<p>As much as possible, transition lines should not cross over each other.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/a/a0/hasmore.PNG\" title=\"/file/images/a/a0/hasmore.PNG\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/a/a0/hasmore.PNG\" height=\"234\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/hasmore_fce30816.png\" style=\"width:439px;height:234px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"439\"/> </a> </p>\n<p><b>Keep Transition Lines Out of Step Names</b></p>\n<p>Use a well-chosen, meaningful step names.
