Load balancers provide load balancing when the traffic hits one of the cluster nodes and is routed by kube-proxy and/or the in-cluster NGINX instances to the backend pods. The keepalived provides failover if a control plane node runs into error. A load balancer acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across the cluster nodes. A load balancer is used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Load_registry\"><a id=\"Load_registry\" name=\"Load_registry\" title=\"Load registry\"></a><a id=\"Load-registry\" name=\"Load-registry\" title=\"Load registry\"></a>Load registry</h3>\n<p>Cluster-internal container image registry.
