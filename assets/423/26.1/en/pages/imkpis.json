To visualize trend information, it's useful to graph KPI data periodically. In addition to the data provided by Service Management, you may need additional tools to report on all of your KPI requirements.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of incidents closed within Service Level Target time</td>\n<td>The number of incidents that are closed within the Service Level Target time, relative to the number of all incidents closed, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of reopened incidents</td>\n<td>The number of incidents closed that are reopened because the solution was not accepted by the customer, relative to the number of all incidents closed, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backlog of incidents</td>\n<td>The number of incidents that aren't yet closed, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total number of incidents</td>\n<td>Total number of new reported incidents, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These are common metrics, however, each standards organization has their own recommendations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ITIL_V3_KPIs\">ITIL V3 KPIs</h2>\n<p>ITIL V3 recommends that you measure these performance indicators for Incident Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of incidents (as a control measure).</li>\n<li>Breakdown of incidents at each stage. For example, the number of incidents logged, work in progress, and closed.</li>\n<li>Size of current incident backlog.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of major incidents.</li>\n<li>Mean elapsed time to achieve incident resolution or a workaround by impact.</li>\n<li>Percentage of incidents handled within the target response time. You can specify incident response-time targets using defined Service Level Targets.</li>\n<li>Average cost for each incident.</li>\n<li>Number of incidents reopened and as a percentage of the total.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of incidents incorrectly assigned. Number and percentage of incidents incorrectly categorized.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of incidents resolved remotely with no on-site visit required.</li>\n<li>Number of incidents handled by each incident model.</li>\n<li>Breakdown of incidents by time of day, which helps pinpoint peaks and ensure matching of resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"COBIT_4.1_KPIs\">COBIT 4.1 KPIs</h2>\n<p>COBIT 4.1 recommends that you measure these performance indicators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percent of incidents resolved within the time period specified</li>\n<li>Percent of incidents reopened Average duration of incidents by severity</li>\n<li>Percent of incidents that require local support (field support or an on-site visit)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"RACI_Matrix_KPIs\">RACI Matrix KPIs</h2>\n<p>The Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) matrix describes the roles and responsibilities of various teams or people in delivering a project or operating a process.
