Services are grouped into categories, such as hardware or software. Services usually support your business infrastructure, such as email or network access. When a service interruption occurs, it can impact revenue or productivity. The severity of the incident often depends on when the interruption occurs. In a global organization, the service needs to be available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. In other scenarios, an interruption during off-peak hours has a smaller impact.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Service Management uses ITIL v3 best practice recommendations to manage the typical incident resolution process. The process depends on incident <i>models</i>, which describe typical incident scenarios or categories, related tasks, and predictable process phases.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/imitilprocess\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/imITILprocess\">Incident Management ITIL process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/firsttouchsolutions\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/FirstTouchSolutions\">First touch solutions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/solutionmatching\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/SolutionMatching\">Incident solution matching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/imwflw\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/imWflw\">Incident workflow</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
