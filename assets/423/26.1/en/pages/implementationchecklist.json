This makes it quite important to implement early in the implementation process while ensuring the data is correctly created (or imported). </p>\n<p>For high-level information on the types of core data needed, see the Getting Started guide <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/coredata\" title=\"here\">here</a>. For information about how to import data, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/importdataformat\" title=\"Import Data Format\">Import Data Format</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐ </strong><strong>Review out-of-the-box Roles and modify or add as necessary</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Review the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pplroles\" title=\"roles documentation\">roles documentation</a>, which includes a list of out of the box roles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create or import Location data</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more details, please review the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/coredata#Locations\" title=\"Locations\">Locations</a> section in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐ Create or import Organizational Groups</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Organizational Groups contain all the boxes on the company’s org chart. Business units, departments, and the company itself are represented as separate but related Organization Groups. </p>\n<p>The Organizational Group also contains information about the Owner/Manager of the Group and all the members of the Organization. Note that a person can only belong to one Organizational Group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create or import Functional Groups</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Functional Groups contain the people responsible for a specific job function or process within the system.  These groups can encompass people who belong to several Organizational Groups or may be used to further break up Organizational Groups into different functions that they support.  For example, within a Department that builds a specific product we can create separate Functional Groups for the Database team, the UI team, and the Application team.  It's also important to note that people can belong to multiple Functional Groups, so people that support multiple processes can belong to all the teams that are necessary.  </p>\n<p>The main thing you will use Functional Groups for is to assign “work”. When you want a specific “Team” to work on a Request, Incident, Change, or even a Task, assign a Functional Group to the record you want them to work on.  From there, you can also assign a specific Group member to the record, so it's not only important to define the Groups but to make sure the correct people are part of the Group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Import any Users that were not part of the SSO integration</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can perform simple imports through the UI, but for more complex information consider using the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/managepersonsapi\" title=\"Manage Persons API\">Manage Persons API</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create or import Contacts (non-users) into the system</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Assign Users to Roles, Locations, and Groups</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For small implementations, this may be manually done, but most implementations will require the use of the Manage Persons API to make bulk updates.  </p>\n<p><font face=\"monospace\">T</font>he <strong>Connect-It</strong> product is one tool that can move information from your internal data sources to Service Management.  <strong>Connect-It</strong> makes use of the Manage Persons API so you can add attributes, set licensing, and add Users to Roles and Groups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Customize the notification header &amp; footer</strong></h3>\n<p>For example, you can replace the logo with your organization's logo. </p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training material with Location and Group information if needed</strong></h3>\n<h2>Define your primary services</h2>\n<p>Services are at the core of most processes within Service Management. Taking the time to define your services fully will improve the productivity of these processes, notably the Service Catalog. You can find more information on defining your services and examples in the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sacmoverview\" title=\"SACM Overview\">SACM Overview</a> chapter of the Getting Started guide.</p>\n<h3> <br/>\n<strong>☐ </strong><strong>Create Service Definitions for a few of your most important/used Services</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For information on adding the Service Definitions, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicedefn\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐ </strong><strong>Create the Actual Service entries that represent these Services in your environment</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For details and an examples, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sacmoverview#Providing_Services\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3> <br/>\n<strong>☐ </strong><strong>Where possible, define the Service Component/System Element hierarchy under these Services</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sacmoverview#Providing_Services\" title=\"this chapter \">this chapter </a>in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3> <br/>\n<strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>optional) Set the primary Functional Groups responsible for supporting these Services either in the Actual Service or an associated Routing Definition</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training material with Service information</strong></h3>\n<h2><strong>Setting up Request Management</strong></h2>\n<p>Request management handles the end to end process of receiving a request from an end user and fulfilling it. A request management process reduces the load on agents by allowing end users to fulfill their own requests without agent involvement either by automating common request offerings (such as password resets) or providing knowledge that will allow the end user to answer a question by themselves. For more information, please read the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestmanagement\" title=\"Request Management\">Request Management</a> chapter in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review the default Record Categories, adding or removing where necessary</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For additional details, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestmanagement#Setting_up_our_Record_Categories\" title=\"this section\">this section</a> in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Import existing Knowledge Articles</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For information on packaging existing articles and importing them into Service Management,see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestmanagement#Importing_Existing_Knowledge\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review Request Roles and ensure Agents have correct Roles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review default Views and Reports, editing or adding if necessary</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestmanagement#Creating_Views_and_Reports_for_the_Dashboard\" title=\"this section\">this section</a> of the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Implement a satisfaction survey if desired</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For further explainations of surveys, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestmanagement#Surveys\" title=\"this section\">this section</a> of the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Define a default Service Level Agreement with Service Targets for Support Requests</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicelevelmanagement\" title=\"Service Level Management\">Service Level Management</a> section of the Getting Started guide .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training materials with Request Management process flows</strong></h3>\n<h2>The Service Catalog</h2>\n<p>To consume the services IT provides, the end users need to have a way of discovering the services available and what actions or requests they can perform against them. The service catalog provides the means of creating those available choices for both the Service Portal (accessed by the end users) and request management (accessed by the agents). </p>\n<p>Before creating your Service Catalog, we recommend reading the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicecatalog\" title=\"associated chapter\">associated chapter</a> in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create the high-level Service Category structure with existing Service Definitions</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For examples and further information on setting up the category structure, see the related information <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicecatalog#The_Catalog_Structure\" title=\"here\">here</a> in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create any necessary Entitlement records to attach to Offerings</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create a few Offerings for each Service</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For information on setting up offerings, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicecatalog#Offering\" title=\"here\">here</a> in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Customize the Self Service Portal look &amp; feel</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example of a tailored service portal, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicecatalog#Tailoring_the_Service_Management_Automation_Service_Portal\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update end user training materials with Self Service Portal information</strong><br/>\n </h3>\n<h2>Setting up Incident Management</h2>\n<p>An Incident encompasses any disruption or degradation of a service, whether the service is internal or external. Issues with redundant hardware (or software) are also handled as an incident, even if the degradation isn't apparent to an end user.</p>\n<p>The goal of the incident management process is to resolve the disruption or degradation as quickly as possible. This may often involve enacting a workaround (such as rebooting a server or restarting a specific service) rather than a permanent fix.</p>\n<p>We highly recommend reviewing the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/incidentmanagement\" title=\"Incident Management chapter\">Incident Management chapter</a> in the Getting Started guide before starting your implementation.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review the default Record Categories, adding or removing where necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Import existing Knowledge Articles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review Incident Roles and ensure Agents have correct Roles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review default Views and Reports, editing or adding if necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Define a default Service Level Agreement with Service Targets</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicelevelmanagement\" title=\"Service Level Management\">Service Level Management</a> section of the Getting Started guide .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create Incident Models and or Templates to assist with Incident creation</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For explanation and examples, see the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/incidentmanagement#Incident_Models\" title=\"Incident Models\">Incident Models</a> section of the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training materials with Incident Management process flows</strong></h3>\n<h2>Setting up problem management</h2>\n<p>A problem is simply the cause of one or more incidents. The aim of the problem process is to minimize the impact of known problems on consumers and prevent recurring incidents.</p>\n<p>Problem management encompasses the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and determine short term workarounds and long term resolutions to those problems. It's also responsible for ensuring the correct resolutions are implemented through the correct control processes such as change management and release management.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/problemmanagement\" title=\"Problem Management chapter\">Problem Management chapter</a> of the Getting Started guide.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review the default Record Categories, adding or removing where necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Import existing Knowledge Articles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review Problem Roles and ensure Agents have correct Roles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review default Views and Reports, editing or adding if necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(optional) Create Problem Templates to assist with Problem creation</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training materials with Problem Management process flows</strong></h3>\n<h2>Setting up Change Management</h2>\n<p>Changes to IT infrastructure may be necessary to respond to problems or externally imposed requirements and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing services. The change management process ensures that standardized methods, processes, and procedures are used for all changes to give efficient and safe handling of all changes to the infrastructure, and is used to determine that the need for change outweighs the potential detrimental impact of changes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/changemanagement\" title=\"Change Management chapter\">Change Management chapter</a> of the Getting Started guide contains additional information on setting up the module.</p>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review the default Record Categories, adding or removing where necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review Change roles and ensure Agents have correct Roles</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Review default Views and Reports, editing or adding if necessary</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create Change Models to guide Agents in most popular and important Changes</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/changemanagement#Creating_Change_Models\" title=\"Change Models\">Change Models</a> section in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Create Time Periods for Change blackout and maintenance periods</strong></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For further information on setting up Time Periods, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/changemanagement#Setting_up_Time_Periods\" title=\"here\">here</a> in the Getting Started guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>☐</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Update Agent training materials with Change management process flows</strong></h3>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
