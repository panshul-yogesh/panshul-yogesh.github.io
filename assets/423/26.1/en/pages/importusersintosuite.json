It involves adding people to both Suite Administration (https://&lt;External Access Host&gt;/bo) and Service Management (the agent interface). The following outlines the methods for importing users into the suite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Types_of_Person_records_in_Service_Management\">Types of Person records in Service Management</h2>\n<p>There are two types of Person records in Service Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users: persons who are able to log in to the Service Portal or the agent interface.</li>\n<li>Contacts: persons who are not able to log in but may be referenced as people using phones or third-party vendors, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Person records are automatically set to be users if there is an account in Suite Administration that matches the UPN of the person in Service Management. The person is set as a contact if there is not a matching account. Removing the user account from Suite Administration changes the Person record from a user to a contact. In <strong>Service Management</strong> &gt; <strong>People</strong>, you can easily convert a user to a contact or the other way around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Determining_how_to_create_users_and_contacts\">Determining how to create users and contacts</h2>\n<p>An important concept to understand is that for a user to be able to log in to Service Management they need a record in two places: one record in Suite Administration, and another in Service Management.</p>\n<p>There is an automatic process that duplicates all users that exist in Suite Administration into Service Management and makes the matching UPN in Service Management a user. The methods of creating users and contacts are outlined below.</p>\n<p>The following table provides a comparison of these methods.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manually creating users in Suite Administration</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and straightforward (UI-based)</li>\n<li>Can create integration users</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Time-consuming if there are a large number of users</li>\n<li>Users are created with much less information than that in the tenant</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manually creating users in the tenant</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and straightforward (UI-based)</li>\n<li>Tenant admin can manage users within the tenant</li>\n<li>There is no need to wait for the suite administrator</li>\n<li>Can add all relevant information</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Time-consuming if there are a large number of users</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using the Manage Persons API</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Tenant admin can manage users and contacts within the tenant</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no need to wait for the suite administrator</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires good knowledge of the Manage Persons API</li>\n<li>Requires good knowledge of script languages</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Importing from CSV</td>\n<td>Editing in Excel</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no pre-check or validation of the CSV file content</li>\n<li>Can create only contacts, not users</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automatic user synchronization by LDAP, SAML, or OAuth authentication</td>\n<td>Users can be automatically synced from an LDAP or IDP server to a tenant</td>\n<td>Still requires additional configuration of groups, user roles, and more basic information for each synced user within the tenant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using the OPB-based LDAP integration</td>\n<td>A built-in capability of Service Management</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Can't set a relationship between a user and group during the creation</li>\n<li>Doesn't create roles</li>\n<li>Doesn't assign licenses</li>\n<li>Can create only contacts, not users</li>\n<li>Doesn't support person record deletion</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using Connect-It</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Can handle complex calculations to prepare all user information</li>\n<li>Supports configuration for sending requests in a batch size</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Requests are asynchronous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"Adding_users_manually_through_My_Account_in_Suite_Administration\">Adding users manually through My Account in Suite Administration</h3>\n<p>You can add and manage users directly through Suite Administration by clicking on the Users menu item and then selecting <b>New</b>.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, Suite Administration manages the accounts and passwords directly. The Email, First and Last Names, and Phone numbers are added to Suite Administration and pushed to Service Management. Additional attributes can be added through a person’s profile in the administration UI of Service Management. If the user is added to Suite Administration and a matching UPN exists in Service Management, the Service Management record is switched from a contact into a user. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createuser\" title=\"How to create a user\">Create users in Suite Administration</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Adding_users_manually_through_My_Account_in_Suite_Administration\">Adding users manually in Service Management</h3>\n<p>Tenant administrators can add users in Service Management directly if the suite admin has enabled the \"Manage users in tenant\" feature in Suite Administration.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, users are also created in Suite Administration and the Email, First and Last Names, UPN, authentication type, and Phone numbers are synced to Suite Administration. Additional attributes are managed in Service Management. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createdeletecontacts\" title=\"How to create and delete users or contacts\">Create users and contacts in the tenant</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Using_the_Manage_Persons_API\">Using the Manage Persons API</h3>\n<p>The Manage Persons REST API provides a way to create or update users and contacts in both Suite Administration and Service Management at the same time. The Manage Persons API can also populate user or contact attributes such as the location, organizational group, functional group and role (role cannot be changed using the other methods, but can be updated manually in the UI).</p>\n<p>A script needs to be generated in the format below that identifies the various attributes. The manage person API matches the name of the location and role and the UPN for the group. If one of the groups specified is an organizational group the user’s organization group is set with this value. If the Manage Persons API finds an existing account in Suite Administration with the same UPN it will update that user, not create a new one.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"> \n<ul>\n<li class=\"Admonition_Note\">If you use the Manage Persons API to import users to the suite, it is recommended that you turn off user auto-sync in <strong>Account details</strong> from Suite Administration.</li>\n<li class=\"Admonition_Note\">Make sure that you set the authentication type property correctly in the Create operation. Otherwise, DB users will be created by default. If you want to change the authentication type later, you need to do it manually by selecting users in Suite Administration &gt; <strong>Users</strong>, and then click the <b>Change authentication type </b>button. For more information about the authentication type configuration, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/managepersonsapi#Configuring_the_AuthenticationType_field\" title=\"Integrate with LDAP\">Manage Persons API</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>JSON Syntax to create a user:</p>\n<pre>{\n\t\"operation\": \"CREATE_OR_UPDATE\",\n\t\"users\": [{\n\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\"Upn\": \"MyNewUser@microfocus.com\",\n\t\t\t\"upnDataType\":\"Customer_UID\", #(only if custom Upn and not Email)\n\t\t\t\"Email\":\"MyNewUser@microfocus.com\",\n\t\t\t\"FirstName\":\"My First Name\",\n\t\t\t\"LastName\":\"My Last Name\",\n\t\t\t\"Location\":\"London\",\t\n\t\t\t\"OfficePhoneNumber\":\"867-5309\",\n\t\t\t\"EmployeeNumber\": \"4815162342\",\n            \"AuthenticationType\": \"LDAP\"\n\t\t}\n\t}]\n}</pre>\n<p>JSON syntax to create a contact:</p>\n<pre>{\n\t\"operation\": \"CREATE_OR_UPDATE\",\n\t\"users\": [{\n\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\t\"Upn\": \"MyNewUser@microfocus.com\",\n\t\t\t\"Email\":\"MyNewUser@microfocus.com\",\n\t\t\t\"FirstName\":\"My First Name\",\n\t\t\t\"LastName\":\"My Last Name\",\n\t\t\t\"Location\":\"London\",\n\t\t\t\"IsMaasUser\":\"false\",\t\t\n\t\t\t\"OfficePhoneNumber\":\"867-5309\",\n\t\t\t\"EmployeeNumber\": \"4815162342\"\n\t\t}\n\t}]\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"Importing_data_from_a_CSV_file\">Importing data from a CSV file</h3>\n<p>You can import contacts (not users, so no account in Suite Administration) directly into Service Management through the import data section of the Records-&gt;Person menu. By specifying the *.Name* next to the field name, you can also add locations and organizational groups (“Location.Name” for example), but unlike the Manage Persons API, you cannot add the role. Contacts do not have a record in Suite Administration, so they are unable to log in to Service Management. If however a user is created in Suite Administration, the person is automatically switched from a contact to a user. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/importdata\" title=\"Import data\">Import data</a> for more information.</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/b/b6/import_person.png\" title=\"/file/images/b/b6/import_person.png\"> <img alt=\"import person.png\" border=\"0\" data-file-height=\"324\" data-file-width=\"1210\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/b/b6/import_person.png\" height=\"214\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/import_person_6e558633.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 214px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a></div>\n<h3 id=\"Automatic_user_synchroization_by_LDAP_or_SAML_authentication\">Automatic user synchronization by LDAP or SAML authentication</h3>\n<p>An integration can be set up that will allow an Active Directory to control the user and password information of a Service Management user. When a user logs in to Service Management Single Sign-On (SSO), a Suite Administration user is automatically created based on the information that exists on the AD server for the Email, First and Last Names and Phone numbers.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to create the user accounts using the other methods described above so that if the matching user information already exists in Suite Administration or a contact exists in Service Management, that account would be used. A best practice to consider is to pre-populate Service Management data for any person that may log in using SSO. On the first login if the information has already been populated any specific entitlements the user may have in the Service Portal based on location or group membership will already be configured and the user will be able to see their offerings immediately. Similarly, if the user has special rights defined by roles that provide additional access, if not pre-populated the user may have to open a request to grant them extra information. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/configureauthenticationinidm\" title=\"How to edit and delete a user\">Configure authentication in IdM Admin Portal</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OPB-based_LDAP_integration\">OPB-based LDAP integration</h3>\n<p>An out-of-the-box configurable integration is available that imports contacts into Service Management from one of the supported LDAP versions. This integration is configured in the Service Management UI and uses the OPB (On-Premises Bridge) to connect to LDAP. It will create new users or update existing users based on a matching UPN. There are configurable filters that allow the integration to determine which users are imported based on criteria set in their profile.</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/d/de/ImportUsers3.png\" title=\"/file/images/d/de/ImportUsers3.png\"> <img alt=\"ImportUsers3.png\" border=\"0\" data-file-height=\"524\" data-file-width=\"694\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/d/de/ImportUsers3.png\" height=\"524\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/ImportUsers3_3d5ad3e1.png\" style=\"width:694px;height:524px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"694\"/> </a></div>\n<p>The integration also supports the selection of attributes to move from a user’s LDAP profile to Service Management. Any fields in LDAP can be configured to move to Service Management. The User principal name (UPN) is the unique value that Service Management uses for user reconciliation. If the UPN does not exist in Service Management a new user is created. If the UPN exists the attributes for that user are updated.

Information regarding using the integration can be found <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/integratecit\" title=\"Integrate with Connect-It\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Best practice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Test on a small set of users before performing large volume jobs</li>\n<li>Combine multiple methods</li>\n<li>Understand what data information is available for each method</li>\n<li>Consider performance impact\n\t<ul>\n<li>Schedule jobs off-peak hours</li>\n<li>Perform scalability testing before implementing the solution</li>\n<li>Perform “diff” vs full import jobs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Data load sets need to meet the validation business rules</li>\n<li>Automate the job</li>\n<li>Check and process errors/warnings</li>\n<li>Automate extra roles addition for Self-Service Portal users using Studio</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Types_of_Person_records_in_Service_Management\">Person avatar colors</h2>\n<p>In Agent Interface, the Person records created in different ways will present different avatar colors.</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/f/fe/avatar_user1.png\" title=\"/file/images/f/fe/avatar_user1.png\"> <img alt=\"avatar_user1.png\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/f/fe/avatar_user1.png\" height=\"73\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/avatar_user1_6f2c9544.png\" style=\"width:800px;height:73px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a></div>\n<p>The following table shows the correspondences between different options of creating Person records and avatar colors:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Avatar color</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manually creating users in Suite Administration</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using the Manage Persons API</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automatic user synchronization by LDAP, SAML, or OAuth authentication</td>\n<td>Dark</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Importing from CSV</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manually creating users or contacts in the tenant</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using the OPB-based LDAP integration</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><br/>\nThe avatar of Person records created using the OPB-based LDAP integration is in light color, but it will change to the dark color after the login using SAML. </p>\n<h2>Related Topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/usersmanagement\" title=\"How to edit and delete a user\">Users</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/userscontacts\" title=\"Users and contacts\">Users and contacts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createuser\" title=\"How to create a user\">How to create a user</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/edituser\" title=\"Manage Persons API\">How to edit or delete a user</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/managepersonsapi\" title=\"Manage Persons API\">Manage Persons API</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
