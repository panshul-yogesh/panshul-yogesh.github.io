Audit collector is a microservice that collects the audits from the NFS file system and passes them to the Audit service via REST. You can deploy the Audit collector using Helm charts.</p>\n<p>Install and configure Audit collector in each of the namespaces that contain the Audit producer services, for example, Service Management and UCMDB. Audit collector requires the Audit producer file system and it will use the Audit producer PVC and subpath.</p>\n<p>This section describes the steps to install the Audit collector.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
