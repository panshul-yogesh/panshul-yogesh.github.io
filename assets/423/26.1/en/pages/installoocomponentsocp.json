The RAS interacts with Central and polls it for operations to execute. Installation of external OO RAS is optional and depends on whether you need additional RASes apart from what's already available when you install OO Central.</li>\n<li>OO Workflow Designer<br/>\n\tOO Workflow Designer is a web based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a standalone product that you can deploy either on a Windows or Linux server. Installing OO Workflow Designer is optional and depends on your requirement to author flows. You need to install the OO Workflow Designer as it's not installed along with OO Central.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information about installing these external components, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/installooexternalcomponents\">Install additional OO components</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
