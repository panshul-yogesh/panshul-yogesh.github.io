The RAS interacts with Central and polls it for operations to execute. Installation of external OO RAS is optional and depends on whether you need additional RASes apart from what's already available when you installed OO Central.</li>\n<li><strong>OO Workflow Designer</strong>: OO Workflow Designer is a web-based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a standalone product deployed on a Windows or Linux server. Installation of OO Workflow Designer is optional and depends on your requirement to author flows. You need to install the OO Workflow Designer as it's not installed along with OO Central.</li>\n<li><strong>OO Studio</strong>: OO Studio is a desktop based application for authoring flows, which is available as a standalone product deployed on a Windows server. Instalation of OO Studio is optional and depends on your requirement to author flows. You need to install the OO Studio as it's not installed along with OO Central. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>The following are prerequisites to install these components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OO Containerized is already installed.</li>\n<li>Install the additional OO components using separate installers in an on-premises environment only.</li>\n<li>Ensure you have enough entropy on Linux OS. To check and set entropy levels, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/insufficiententropypool\" title=\"OO start up is stuck due to insufficient entropy pool\">OO start-up is stuck due to insufficient entropy pool</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Download installation files from the Service Management UI</h2>\n<p>To download the OO RAS and Workflow Designer installation files from the Service Management UI: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run a script as the suite admin so that the OPB download center in Service Management displays direct download links for OO RAS and OO Workflow Designer.</li>\n<li>Log in to the Service Management agent interface as the tenant admin.</li>\n<li>Go to the OPB download center, and click the download links. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>For details, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/customizeoodownloadlinks\" title=\"Enable direct download of OO RAS and OO Workflow Designer from the Service Management UI\">Enable direct download of OO RAS and OO Workflow Designer from the Service Management UI</a>. </p>\n<h2>Install OO RAS, Workflow Designer and Studio</h2>\n<p>For information on how to install OO RAS, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/installooras\" title=\"Install OO RAS\">Install OO RAS</a>.</p>\n<p>For information on how to install OO Designer, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/ooworkflowdesigner\" title=\"Install OO Workflow Designer\">Prepare and Install OO Workflow Designer</a>.</p>\n<p>For information on how to install OO Studio, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/installoostudio\" title=\"Install OO Studio\">Install OO Studio</a>.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
