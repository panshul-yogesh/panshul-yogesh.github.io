  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>When creating a service design in Image Aggregation (IA), the instance type doesn't load for IA running on the public cloud.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>If your external OO RAS is configured on an on-premises environment, the Deployment Resource Providers must be created with proxy settings to connect with Azure APIs through OO flows. Since Image Aggregation, which runs on public clouds, does not require proxy settings, during design creation, the instance types won’t load, because the OO flow (running on-premises) and IA (running on the public cloud) both are using the same Deployment Resource Provider.</p>\n<h2>Workaround</h2>\n<p>Create one more Deployment Resource Provider with the same credentials which were used for IA integration and configure proxy details on that Deployment Resource Provider. This way, when creating a design, the IA will use the default provider which was created during integration creation that doesn't have a proxy, and during subscription creation, the service portal user can select the alternate provider which was created with proxy details for fulfillment of the subscription.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
