If necessary, submit a PCS ticket for further assistance.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the disk may show available space (for example, a few GB left), yet IDOL can still display the above error log. This issue is related to the content's utilization of the file system and the resource claiming methods. It is also connected to various implementations and management practices of Kubernetes NFS storage, such as Azure Disk or AWS EBS. If no other problems are detected, consider extending the file system as a first step.</p>\n<h2>Solution 2</h2>\n<p>For file permission issues with the storage folder, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access the filesystem of the content pod.</li>\n<li>Go to the folder related to your IDOL content pod to change the file ownership recursively. For example, \n\t<pre>cd itsma-smarta-saw-con-0/\nchown -R 1999:1999 ./\n</pre>\n\tHere, <strong>1999 </strong>is an example user ID and group ID. The actual values depend on the user and group specified in the security context when you install or start up your suite.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Solution 3</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, incorrect operations can lead to issues with the data folder structure. Typically, when the content pod starts, it initializes its folder structure, like this:</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/general/SMA244_mountIssue.png\" title=\"/file/images/general/SMA244_mountIssue.png\"> <img alt=\"mountIssue\" height=\"61\" src=\"../../../images/SMA244_mountIssue_30f0fa1a.png\" width=\"396\"/> </a></div>\n<p>However, modifying this folder structure without restarting the corresponding content pod can cause issues, as the running pod may lose access to the mounted file system, leading the content application to throw an \"Insufficient Disk Space\" error.</p>\n<p>After making changes to the IDOL content storage data or configuration files, make sure that you restart all related pods (such as DAH, DIH, and Content pods) to ensure proper access and functionality.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
