For example, from a Service Management SaaS environment to an Asset Manager in the customer's data center.</li></ul><p>We recommend running Service Management and Asset Manager on the same network.</p><h4>Cloud/On-Premises</h4><p>If Service Management runs in a cloud/on-premises environment, the connectivity depends on your network settings. If an HTTP connection can be established between the 2 systems, you can use the solution directly; if not, consider using the On-Premises Bridge.</p><h2>Key concepts</h2><p>To effectively use this solution, you need to understand the following concepts.</p><h3>Nature vs. Record type</h3><p>In Asset Manager, most of the managed items are called “portfolio items”. Each item has a “nature” that defines what this item is. The fields of a portfolio item might be saved into an “overflow table” depending on its nature, such as the <strong>amAsset</strong> table and <strong>amCompute</strong> table.</p><p>In Service Management, the corresponding concept is “record type”. Different record types have different fields and life cycles (workflows). For more information on record types, see the Service Management documentation regarding Studio.</p><p>To migrate a record from AM to Service Management, the first step is to decide its nature, that is, the corresponding record type in Service Management.</p><p>Example:</p><div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/68/NatureRecType.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/6/68/NatureRecType.jpg\"><img alt=\"NatureRecType.jpg\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/6/68/NatureRecType.jpg\" height=\"390\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/NatureRecType_db7da593.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 390px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/></a></div><h3>Dependencies and migration sequence</h3><p>The data model in AM is relational. The relationships between the AM records are built via the foreign key at the database level. Service Management also uses the rational data model. Each record has a unique ID. Cross-entity references are built via this unique ID. However, Service Management doesn’t force referential integrity at the database level. This means that in most cases, we can first create the record in Service Management, and then set up the relationships between the records.</p><p>In Service Management,when you create some records, the system doesn't verify whether the relationship field is empty or not. We can check if the validation is performed by a business rule and whether this rule can be temporarily disabled in the migration process. If not, the field is a “hard” dependency. We must first migrate the related item first.</p><h3>Unidirectional relation</h3><p>In Service Management,the basic relations are unidirectional. For example, an accounting period references a fiscal year.</p><div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/b/b5/Unidirectional_relation.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/b/b5/Unidirectional_relation.jpg\"><img alt=\"Unidirectional_relation.jpg\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/b/b5/Unidirectional_relation.jpg\" height=\"68\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/Unidirectional_relation_b655218f.jpeg\" style=\"width:415px;height:68px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"415\"/></a></div><p>In this case, we recommend that you follow this migration sequence:</p><ol><li>Migrate Fiscal Year</li><li>Migrate Accounting Period and set up its reference to the Fiscal Year at the same time</li></ol><h3>Bidirectional relation and loop relation</h3><p>In Service Management,there’re bidirectional relations and loop relations. For example, the organization of the Person record is a “Group”, and the owner of the Group record is a “Person.”</p><div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/1/1d/loop_relation.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/1/1d/loop_relation.jpg\"><img alt=\"loop_relation.jpg\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/1/1d/loop_relation.jpg\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/loop_relation_52d9b78b.jpeg\" style=\"width:342px;height:75px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"342\"/></a></div><p>In this case, we recommend that you follow this migration sequence:</p><ol><li>Migrate Person, and at this time, keep the Person’s organization empty</li><li>Migrate Organization, and at this time, set the Group’s owner because Person has already been migrated</li><li>Update Person again, which sets up only the relationship of Organization because Group has been migrated</li></ol><h3>Self-reference</h3><p>Sometimes, a record will reference another record with the same record type. We call this a self-reference relation. For example, a cost center might have a parent cost center.</p><div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/4/47/Self-reference.jpg\" title=\"/file/images/4/47/Self-reference.jpg\"><img alt=\"Self-reference.jpg\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/4/47/Self-reference.jpg\" height=\"126\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/Self-reference_74f49ab6.jpeg\" style=\"width:251px;height:126px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"251\"/></a></div><p>In this case, we recommend that you follow this migration sequence: Migrate Cost Center order by level, starting with the lowest level</p><h3>Dependencies between record types</h3><p>The following image shows the related record types in Service Management. To reduce updates, we recommend that you migrate the record types by business module. The following migration sequence is recommended but it’s not mandatory: Financial &gt; Master data &gt; Procurement &gt; SACM &gt; SAM &gt; Contract.</p><div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/9/9d/AssetManagerDiagramUsedInSMAXXIEIntg.png\" title=\"/file/images/9/9d/AssetManagerDiagramUsedInSMAXXIEIntg.png\"><img alt=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/9/9d/AssetManagerDiagramUsedInSMAXXIEIntg.png\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/9/9d/AssetManagerDiagramUsedInSMAXXIEIntg.png\" height=\"598\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/AssetManagerDiagramUsedInSMAXXIEIntg_048f8219.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 598px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/></a></div><h3>Reconciliation key</h3><p>The reconciliation key is a field available on both the AM record and the Service Management record. It relates an AM record to its corresponding record in Service Management. For example, both Asset Manager and Service Management have the “BarCode” information on a device. The migration script might need to run repeatedly. In this case, you can use the reconciliation key to distinguish whether the CREATE or UPDATE action is required. Also, to set up a relationship (entity link or many-to-many association) between records, you must first define the reconciliation key for each record.</p><p>The reconciliation key should be unique, immutable, non-null, and human-readable and doesn’t contain special characters (such as “&amp;”, space, and “%”).</p><h3>Data model mapping</h3><p>Most records in Service Management can find their peers in AM tables. For example, you can find the peer for “Device” from the <strong>amCompute</strong> table, and the peer for “Asset Model” from the <strong>amModel</strong> table. The fields of these records can also be mapped from the corresponding AM table. </p><p>The mapping descriptions are provided based on the out-of-the-box (OOTB) data model of AM and Service Management. However, the data structure of Service Management and Asset Manager might be different, especially for a customized AM system. In this case:</p><ul><li>If you want to migrate a field that is not available in Service Management from AM, you can use Service Management Studio to create a field. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/fieldsadd\" title=\"Create a field\">Create a field</a>.</li><li>If you want to migrate a record type that is not available in Service Management from AM, you can use Service Management Studio to create a record type.</li></ul><h3>Data inapplicable to migration</h3><p>Due to the limitations of EMS APIs, some data might not be migrated. Data that isn’t applicable to this migration solution includes:</p><ul><li>Data stored in satellite tables in EMS, such as expense lines.</li><li>Cost allocation rules: The rules implemented in Service Management are different from those in AM. We recommend that you reimplement the rules.</li><li>Data coming from third-party systems, such as fixed assets and purchase orders/lines.</li><li>Fields whose data type in Service Management is Complex Type, such as the History field of each record or the CPUs field of the Device record. The Attachment field doesn’t belong to this case.</li></ul><h2>Prepare Service Management</h2><p>To be able to import the data from Asset Manager into Service Management,the following steps are required.</p><h3>Prepare an integration user for your Service Management tenant</h3><p>Perform the following steps to prepare an integration user:</p><ol><li>Create an integration user. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createuser\" title=\"How to create an integration user\">How to create an integration user</a>. </li><li>Assign the Tenant Admin role to the new Integration User.</li></ol><h3>Create an agent (optional)</h3><p>In case the connection to the Asset Manager system is using the On-Premises Bridge, create an Agent in Service Management first.</p><h3>Create an endpoint</h3><p>Create an endpoint by using the Rest Executor 2.0 endpoint type:</p><ol><li>Log in to the agent interface as the tenant admin.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Administration &gt; Utilities &gt; Integration &gt; Endpoints</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>Select Rest Executor 2.0 as the endpoint type, enter a name for the endpoint, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.
