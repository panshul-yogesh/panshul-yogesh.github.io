  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>Integrations between two Open Text Service Management systems are typically used to exchange data between different two tenants. With the Integration Studio, you can easily configure integration solutions to query and exchange data between tenants. For example, you can forward requests from a tenant where HR tickets are managed to a tenant that is used by your internal IT department. Communications can be in both directions to efficiently keep all involved tickets in the tenants up-to-date and in sync.</p>\n<p>The Integration Studio provides several Service Management to Service Management scenario templates to support the following use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Incident exchange, for example, to exchange incidents between internal IT and service providers.
