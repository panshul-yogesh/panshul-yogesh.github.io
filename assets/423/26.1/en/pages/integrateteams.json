It's a central place to collaborate with everyone in your organization. SMAX integrates with Microsoft Teams in several ways. By integrating Microsoft Teams with business apps like Service Management,you can break down silos between departments and increase cross-functional communication and collaboration. For example, integrating Microsoft Teams with SMAX can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and up-to-date on their requests and ongoing IT activities. You can automate notifications and alerts for specific events or changes in Service Management. This can help ensure that everyone is notified of important updates in a timely manner and reduce the need for manual communication. This can help reduce miscommunication and misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals. While you have many choices for how to integrate with Teams, let's highlight some options supported by Service Management.</p>\n<h2>Bot-based interactions</h2>\n<p>A bot provides the most comprehensive solution to facilitate this integration. A bot in Teams offers users a friendly and intuitive way to ask for help, from answering simple questions, drawing on your existing knowledge base, to providing resolution instructions, and ultimately creating and assigning new service tickets for issues that the bot cannot resolve. On the other hand, a bot requires maintenance and configuration to ensure that all use cases are properly handled.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/8/89/TeamsBotMessage.png\" title=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/8/89/TeamsBotMessage.png\"> <img alt=\"Conversation between teams bot and user\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/8/89/TeamsBotMessage.png\" height=\"800\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/TeamsBotMessage_e8c3734b.png\" style=\"width: 634.884px; height: 800px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"634.8837209302326\"/> </a></p>\n<p>For details about how to set up the above use cases, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/integrateteamsbot\" title=\"Teams bot integration\">Set up Teams bot integration</a>.</p>\n<h2>Notifications into private / group chats</h2>\n<p>Another option to improve collaboration is to leverage the Microsoft Graph API and Bot APIs in Integration Studio. This allows you to create private chats between agents and end users or to create group chats around a specific topic like a major incident and programmatically add the required persons to the chat. Several templates are available for those use cases.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/a/af/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_major_incident.png\" title=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/a/af/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_major_incident.png\"> <img alt=\"private or group chat example\" border=\"1\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/a/af/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_major_incident.png\" height=\"357\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_major_incident_2b5af055.png\" style=\"width:531px;height:357px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:1px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"531\"/> </a></p>\n<p>You can start with the templates <em>Teams- Send notification in channel</em> or <em>Teams - Send notification in group chat</em>.</p>\n<h2>Push notifications into teams and channels</h2>\n<p>In some cases, it's good enough to just push some messages into teams and their channels to enable cross-team collaboration. This solution can be configured using the SMAX-embedded MS Teams logic and is easier to set up and maintain, but provides less flexibility and functionality.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/4/4b/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_contract.png\" title=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/4/4b/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_contract.png\"> <img alt=\"teams channel notification example\" border=\"1\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/4/4b/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_contract.png\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/SMAX_202105_teams_usecase_contract_dfea3d70.png\" style=\"width:533px;height:355px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:1px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"533\"/> </a></p>\n<p>For details about how to set up this use case, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/integratemsteamsthroughintegrationhub\" title=\"Teams channel notifications\">Set up Teams channel notifications</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
