  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n<p>SAM provides a comprehensive solution for software license management, allowing you to manage your license effectively, control the company's budget for software licensing, and avoid potential compliance risks. Effective license management improves the transparency in software license usage across your organization, enabling you to make full use of the available license points and help optimize future business decisions. The best practice documentation includes the following license upgrade scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Automatic license upgrades as per maintenance contracts</li>\n<li>License upgrades with metric changes</li>\n<li>License upgrades via purchasing upgrade licenses</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a id=\"Concepts\" name=\"Concepts\" title=\"Concepts\"></a>Concepts</h2>\n<p>SAM needs to check the following aspects as the prerequisites for managing license upgrades that will decide which license upgrade scenario the upgrade is applicable to.</p>\n<table cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\">Concept</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>License model</td>\n<td>License model is essential for license management and defines the characteristics of each license. It's linked to every individual license and contains common attributes like the license metric and software version coverage, specified in the<strong> Software coverage</strong> section. Additional details such as <strong>Count per pack</strong>, <strong>Pack price</strong>, and <strong>Currency</strong> can also be included.<br/>\n\t\t\tFor more information about license model, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sameditlicensemodel\" title=\"Edit a license model\">Edit a license model</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\">License type</td>\n<td>\n<p>Perpetual &amp; subscription license</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A perpetual license indicates the license rights are permanently available. With effective maintenance contract, you‘re entitled to access the latest version without additional cost. You can create a perpetual license by checking the<strong> Perpetual</strong> license<strong> </strong>checkbox.</li>\n<li>A subscription license is only available during a certain period. Once it expires, you'll have no access to use the software. You can create a subscription license by clearing <strong>Perpetual </strong>license checkbox. The <strong>Start date</strong> and <strong>End date </strong>fields<strong> </strong>indicate the availability period of the subscription license.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Full license &amp; upgrade license</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A full license grants you independent access to the corresponding version or its lower versions.</li>\n<li>An upgrade license is a separate license that must be combined with previous base licenses to obtain the desired rights. Upgrade licenses can't be used on their own and are useless without base licenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>License phase</td>\n<td>\n<p>Service Management employs a system of metaphases and subordinate phases to indicate the status of licenses at different stages of their lifecycle in the license management process. The metaphases are comprised of<strong> Unavailable</strong>, <strong>Available</strong>, <strong>In use</strong>,<strong> Retiring</strong>, and <strong>End of Life</strong>. SAM identifies effective licenses by recognizing their subordinate phases, including customer subordinate phases, in the <strong>Available</strong> or <strong>In use</strong> metaphase.</p>\n<p>The out of the box subordinate phases are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Available</strong> metaphase includes the subordinate phase of <strong>Receive</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>In use</strong> metaphase includes subordinate phases: <strong>Pool</strong> and <strong>Prepare</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>License use rights</td>\n<td>\n<p>License use rights refer to the terms and benefits provided by the end user license agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>License use rights configuration is only available for perpetual licenses. For subscription type license, there's no need to configure the use rights.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sameditlicenserec#Use_rights_tab\" title=\"Use rights\">Use rights</a>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Effective license summary</td>\n<td>\n<p>SAM builds an effective license summary against product licenses, covering the use cases outlined in this document. With this information, you can know what effective licenses you are entitled to use and how many licenses are consumed by your organization. You can view <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/samanalysis#View_license_compliance_information\" title=\"effective license summary\">effective license summary</a> in <strong>Compliance</strong> and <strong>Analysis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note that the license summary is calculated per product. If you add a new license, it may not immediately reflect in the effective license summary as SAM takes some time to rebuild the summary accordingly.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>License compatibility matrix</td>\n<td>The license compatibility matrix includes license downgrade matrix and upgrade matrix.\n\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Downgrade matrix: Most publishers provide downgrade rights in license agreements, which legally grants you to use a prior version of the software.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tYou can define the version downgrade and edition downgrade in the downgrade matrix.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Version downgrade: License downgrade among versions with same edition like from the higher Standard version to the lower Standard version.</li>\n<li>Edition downgrade: License downgrade among versions with different editions. For example, downgrade license from the Enterprise edition to the Standard edition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: SAM tries version downgrade first. If no edition downgrade is available, only version downgrade occurs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Upgrade matrix: </span>This grants you the rights to the higher version of the software when it's released.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSAM includes version upgrade and edition upgrade:\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Version upgrade: Normally, you'll be entitled to access new version rights of the product without additional cost as long as you have the effective maintenance contract.</li>\n<li>Edition upgrade: For most publishers, purchasing a separate upgrade license is required to access license use rights of a different edition .</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/samproducts#Maintain_license_compatibility_matrix\" title=\"Maintain license compatibility matrix\">Maintain license compatibility matrix</a>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Product release lifecycle</td>\n<td>SAM allows you to enter product release information in the <strong>Products</strong> page. This enables SAM to automatically enroll for new versions by comparing the<strong> Expires on </strong>date of a maintenance contract for a perpetual license or the <strong>End date </strong>of a subscription license.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>License rule</td>\n<td>SAM offers out-of-the-box license rules for supported software that comply with the licensing rules of the publishers to calculate license usage. It's a best practice to reuse the existing license rules for the same publishers when possible. If no matching rule is available, you can create a new license rule. For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/samlicenserules\" title=\"License rules\">License rules</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maintenance contract</td>\n<td>\n<p>Most software publishers provide maintenance contracts to grant the license upgrade capability.<br/>\n\t\t\tTo create a new maintenance contract for a license in Service Management, navigate to Service Management<strong> Contract Management</strong>, create the contract, and then add the<strong> Covered licenses</strong> to the contract. Note that if you leave the <strong>Expires on</strong> field empty, SAM will deem the licenses covered by the contract as \"never expire\" in its calculation.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/addupdatecontract\" title=\"Create or update a contract record\">Create or update a contract record</a>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<h2><a id=\"SAM_license_management_workflow\" name=\"SAM_license_management_workflow\" title=\"SAM license management workflow\"></a>SAM license management workflow</h2>\n<p>When a new version of a product is released and deployed in the production environment, it's necessary to perform certain actions to ensure that the new version is properly licensed and remains compliant.

The metric change is also recognized as license migration that will influence the license consumption results because the license rules change accordingly. The prerequisite is that you should have available maintenance contracts that support to upgrade to the versions that license metric change on.</p>\n<p>To manage the license upgrades with metric changes, complete the following configurations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Run &gt; Software Asset &gt; Licenses </strong>page, and open the license details of a selected record.</li>\n<li>Open the<strong> Use rights </strong>tab. Note that<strong> Use rights</strong> tab is only available for a perpetual license.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>License migration</strong> section, input the values for the <strong>Migrate to </strong>and <strong>Total rights after migration</strong> fields.\n\t<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Migrate to</strong> field links to a specific license model which has expected license metric and product versions that license metric changed on or higher versions that can be covered by maintenance contract period.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Total rights</strong> <strong>after migration</strong> field defines the total number of license points after the license migration happens.</li>\n<li>If you want to partially migrate the license, split the license first.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When building effective licenses, SAM needs to consider the following rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SAM will use<strong> Total rights after migration</strong> to build effective license rights.</li>\n<li>SAM will look up <strong>Upgrade </strong>matrix in the <strong>License compatibility matrix</strong> on the product details page to validate the upgrade path.</li>\n<li>If there's effective maintenance contract for an upgrade license, SAM will auto upgrade the license to its latest version from the current upgrade license. For more information, see the<em> Case 1: Automatic license upgrades as per maintenance contracts </em>section.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a id=\"Case_3:_License_upgrades_via_purchasing_upgrade_licenses\" name=\"Case_3:_License_upgrades_via_purchasing_upgrade_licenses\" title=\"Case 3: License upgrades via purchasing upgrade licenses\"></a>Case 3: License upgrades via purchasing upgrade licenses</h4>\n<p>Considering the software development cycle, new versions are usually based on the old versions. To get the latest version of software, you can either directly buy the full license of the new release or purchase an upgrade license. Currently, a number of software vendors provide a more economical business option of upgrade licenses that enables the customers who purchased the licenses for older software releases to use the new features available in the newest software releases. In this case, the upgrade licenses aren’t standalone licenses and need to work with the original base licenses.</p>\n<p>Do the following to carry out the license upgrades via purchasing upgrade licenses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Following <strong>Run &gt; Software Asset &gt; Licenses</strong>, create a new upgrade license from the <strong>Licenses</strong> page. Select the <strong>Perpetual</strong> license<strong> </strong>and <strong>Upgrade license</strong> checkbox, and move its phase to the <strong>Receive</strong>, <strong>Pool</strong>, or <strong>Prepare </strong>subordinate phase.<br/>\n\t(Optional) You can utilize the license model for a full licenses by following step 1 of the perpetual license creation process to create a new licensing model in case 1.</li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Contract management </strong>page via clicking <strong>Plan</strong> &gt; <strong>Contract </strong>to create a new maintenance contract. In the <strong>Contract details</strong> section, set<strong> Effective from</strong> and <strong>Expires on</strong> fields. In the<strong> Covered licenses</strong> section, add the newly created license into the list.</li>\n<li>Go to newly created upgrade license and set <strong>Default maintenance contract</strong> field in the <strong>Maintenance</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Go to the previous license that you want to upgrade and open the license details page.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Use rights </strong>tab and set <strong>Upgrade to </strong>field by selecting the new upgrade license in the <strong>Upgrade license</strong> ssection.</li>\n<li>To validate the configuration is successful, you can go to the details page of the new upgrade license and click its <strong>Use rights </strong>tab. If successful, the previous license should be displayed in the <strong>Upgrade from </strong>section.</li>\n<li>If you want to partially upgrade previous license, split the previous license first.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When building effective licenses, SAM needs to consider the following rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the license metric is the same for both previous and upgrade licenses, SAM will choose the minimum Total entitlements between them to avoid license wastes. If the license metric isn't the same, SAM will take advantage of the Total entitlements of upgrade licenses.</li>\n<li>SAM will look up <strong>Upgrade </strong>matrix in the <strong>License compatibility matrix</strong> on the product details page to validate the upgradable versions. If you want to upgrade among different editions, make sure the <strong>Edition</strong> <strong>upgrade</strong> is configured in the <strong>Upgrade </strong>matrix.</li>\n<li>If have effective maintenance contract for upgrade license, SAM will auto-upgrade the license to the latest versions from the current upgrade license. See the <em>Case 1: Automatic license upgrades as per maintenance contracts </em>section.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a id=\"View_effective_license_summary_in_Analysis\" name=\"View_effective_license_summary_in_Analysis\" title=\"View effective license summary in Analysis\"></a>View effective license summary in Analysis</h2>\n<p>To view the license summary of the product, navigate to the<strong> Analysis </strong>page. On this page, you'll find the overall effective license summary that covers all the use cases mentioned above. If you want to know which license records make up the effective license pool, you can view the details of the effective license summary. For details, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/samanalysis#Consumption\" title=\"View license compliance information\">View license compliance information</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"Push_compliance_results_to_license_usage\" name=\"Push_compliance_results_to_license_usage\" title=\"Push compliance results to license usage\"></a>Push compliance results to license usage</h2>\n<p>After performing compliance calculations, the results for the product's compliance will be returned to the License usage<strong> </strong>entity, which is grouped by license models. It's important to note that the SAM compliance report is based on the product version and license metric. When SAM returns the compliance results to the license usage record, it may match multiple records for the license model, product version, and license metric.<br/>\nIn these situations, SAM will follow the rules below to return the compliance results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Total entitlements</strong>, <strong>Consumed entitlements</strong> (for user-based products, including <strong>Assigned entitlements</strong>, <strong>Consumed entitlements</strong>, and <strong>Unassigned entitlements consumed</strong>), and <strong>Balance </strong>will be pushed to the matched license usage record with the latest value of <strong>Last Update Time</strong> on the linked license model.</li>\n<li><strong>Purchased entitlements</strong>, <strong>Purchased upgrade entitlements</strong>, and <strong>Entitlements consumed by higher versions </strong>will be pushed to the matched license usage record by matching the license model, product version, and license metric.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If no license usage record is matched, a new license model will be created for review. For steps of how to cretae a new license model, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/samlicenseusage#Create_a_license_usage_record\" title=\"Create a license usage\">Create a license usage</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"Limitations\" name=\"Limitations\" title=\"Limitations\"></a>Limitations</h2>\n<p>SAM doesn‘t support to manually create products, and all products must be synced directly from the UD/UCMDB. If the purchased license is for a product version that doesn't exist in the UD/UCMDB, you can't link the correct product version to the license model in the <strong>Software Coverage</strong> section on the<strong> License Model</strong> page. To use the license, it's recommended to upgrade your installation to the newest version in your environment and then sync the product family from UCMDB again on the <strong>Products </strong>page.</p>\n</div>",
