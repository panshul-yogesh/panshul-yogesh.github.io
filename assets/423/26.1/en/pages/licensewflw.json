Rules repeat from one phase to another when the end user can make a change to a field affected by a business rule during that phase. For more information about the out-of-the-box business rules defined for the license workflow, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/processlicense\" title=\"SMAX:Main/ProcessLicense\">License process - Business rules</a>.</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"\"> <img alt=\"License workflow\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"437\" src=\"../../../images/licensew_c805f694.png\" width=\"941\"/> </a></div>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Metaphase:_Unavailable\">Metaphase: Unavailable</h2>\n<p>The software license is entered into the system and still awaiting delivery.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Transition</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New</td>\n<td>Manual</td>\n<td>\n<p><b>New</b> is a starting point.</p>\n<p>If the license is awaiting delivery from a vendor, you can manually transition the record to the <b>Awaiting delivery</b> phase.</p>\n<p>If the license is available and ready to use, you can manually transition the record to the <b>Pool</b> phase.</p>\n<p><b>Next phase:</b> <b>Pool</b> or <b>Awaiting delivery</b></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Awaiting delivery</td>\n<td>Manual</td>\n<td>\n<p>The software license is in transit from a software publisher or other vendor.
