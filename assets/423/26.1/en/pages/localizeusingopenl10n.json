  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n<div></div>\n<p>The Openl10n community site enables you to localize Service Management into certain languages that aren't officially supported by Service Management. You can also use this approach to update the existing translation for the officially supported languages.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, the Openl10n tool supports only the localization of the Service Portal, agent portal, and Service Catalog data.</li>\n<li>After you upgrade the suite to a new version, you need to download the language pack of the new version from the Openl10n website, then re-implement the translation and redeploy it. </li>\n<li>If you want to modify the strings when the language setting in your profile is <b>English (U.S.)</b>, you need to download the language pack for <b>English</b>.</li>\n<li>Don't overwrite a language pack with another language that has a different language code, even for those similar languages. For example, if you want to add Portuguese (Portugal) or Chinese (Traditional / Taiwan) languages, you must download <strong>pt-PT</strong> language pack for Portuguese (Portugal) or <strong>zh-TW</strong> language pack for Chinese (Traditional / Taiwan), rather than use the <strong>Portuguese (Brazil)</strong> <strong>pt-BR</strong> or the <strong>Chinese (Simplified / China) zh-CN</strong> language pack directly and do some modifications on the wording. Otherwise, the system won't add the new languages (<strong>pt-PT</strong> or <strong>zh-TW</strong>) to the user profile list, thus you won't be able to select Portuguese (Portugal) or Chinese (Traditional / Taiwan) in the user profile list to switch the language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For details, see <a href=\"/doc/363/openl10n/localizesmax\" title=\"Localize Service Management by using OpenL10N\">Localize Service Management by using OpenL10N</a>.</p>\n</div>",
