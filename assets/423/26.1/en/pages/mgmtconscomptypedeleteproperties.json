Because service designs are considered a snapshot in time of the components, and to preserve the integrity of service designs that are provisioned, the propagation of component type properties doesn't affect service designs. You must manually update any service design that uses the component type, its subtypes, or its templates.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You can't delete a component type property in the following cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the property is considered to be system critical.</li>\n<li>When property references exist to a component template property that's inherited from this component type property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"To_delete_component_type_properties\">To delete component type properties</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In the left pane of the Sequenced Components area, select the component palette that contains the component type whose properties you want to delete.</li>\n<li>Click the component type whose properties you want to delete.</li>\n<li>Select the <b>Properties</b> tab.</li>\n<li>In the Properties tab, click the gear icon for the property and select <b>Delete</b>.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Yes</b> in the confirmation dialog.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
