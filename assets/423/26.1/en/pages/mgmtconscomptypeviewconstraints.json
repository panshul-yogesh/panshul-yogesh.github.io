These constraints apply to service components within a service design that are created from this component type.</p>\n<p>Component type constraints limit the types of service components that can be connected to components of this type within a service design. For example, a service component of type Server may be allowed connections only to components of types Application Layer, Network Connection, Software Component, and Storage Volume.</p>\n<p>Resource category constraints limit the categories of resource offerings that can be bound to service components of this type. For example, a Server service component may be allowed only to resource offerings associated with service components that are assigned the categories Application, Compliance, Compute, Configuration Management, Monitoring, Network, Service Usage, and Storage.</p>\n<p>A component type can establish constraints in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Defined constraints</b> - specified directly on component types.</li>\n<li><b>Inherited constraints</b> - inherited by component types from the hierarchy of types they are derived from. In the list of constraints, the path of inheritance is listed next to the name of each component type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"To_view_the_constraints_of_a_component_type\">To view the constraints of a component type</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>In the left pane of the Sequenced Components area, select the component palette that contains the component type whose constraints you want to view.</li>\n<li>Click the component type whose constraints you want to view.</li>\n<li>Select the <b>Constraints</b> tab.</li>\n<li>Select the type of constraint you want to view: Component Types or Resource Categories.</li>\n<li>Review the list of constraints.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
