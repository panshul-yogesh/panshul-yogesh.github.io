One provider can deploy virtual machines, while another provider can monitor applications. A provider corresponds to the specific instance of an application and integrates with the application to help instantiate service designs.</p>\n<p>A <b>provider type</b> allows you to classify providers for improved filtering and identification and includes some predefined, out-of-the-box provider types.</p>\n<p>Each instance of a resource offering can have a single provider type. In addition, resource offerings can be associated only with providers that share the same provider type.</p>\n<p>After adding a resource offering to a service component, you must create one or more provider selection actions for that resource offering. Be sure to do this if you have configured a resource environment for a catalog in order to control which resource providers should be used when service offerings are ordered from a specific catalog. Otherwise, the default, random selection of a resource provider that occurs when provider selection actions aren't called will ignore the resource environment association to a catalog. The provider selection actions run during the Before phase of the Reserving lifecycle stage; the lifecycle stage can't be changed.</p>\n<p>The product ships with internal actions to help with provider selection. For more information about these provider selection internal actions, see Provider selection internal actions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<p>The resource offering <b>Provider tab</b> displays information about current providers associated with the resource offering, and is accessible from the resource offering's details page.</p>\n<p>You can perform the following actions in the Provider tab gear icon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>View details</b> — Click a provider <b>name</b> to view provider details.</li>\n<li><b>Delete</b> — Chose <b>delete</b> to delete the resource offering.</li>\n<li><b>Select</b> — Click <b>Select Providers</b> to display a list of available providers that you can associate to a resource offering.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To know what all out-of-the-box internal actions are shipped, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssdprovselectintact\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/MgmtConsSDProvSelectIntAct\">Provider selection internal actions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
