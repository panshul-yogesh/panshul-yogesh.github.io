A service design is a template (or blueprint) for an orderable service. Service designs include a hierarchy of service components, resource bindings, subscriber options, lifecycle actions, and custom properties, as defined by the Service Designer. Service components and their relationships in a service design define the framework for creating the service.</p>\n<p>Service designs also provide a structure for options that consumers can select when ordering a service. You can re-use designs for multiple service offerings, with each service offering customized to meet the needs of different consumer organizations and groups. You can also leverage service designs shipped with the product as well as exporting and importing designs between systems.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<p>The <b>Service Design tab</b>, in the resource offerings details page, allows you to perform several tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>View list</b> - View a list of service designs that use the resource offerings.</li>\n<li><b>Select a service design</b> - Click a service-design name to select it and to display its details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See topic View service design and view service design version to add, edit, copy, or delete a service design.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssdview\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/MgmtConsSDView\">View service design and view service design version</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
