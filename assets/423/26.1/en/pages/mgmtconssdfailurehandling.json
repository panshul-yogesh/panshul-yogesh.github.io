The Provisioning lifecycle stages include Initializing, Reserving, and Deploying, the Modification lifecycle stage is Modifying, and the Cancellation or De-Provisioning lifecycle stages include Un-deploying, Un-reserving, and Un-initializing.  For more information on lifecycle stages, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssdeditcomplifecycleactions\">Lifecycle actions for service design</a>.</p>\n<p>If you select Pause on Errors for a lifecycle stage, a service instance created from this design will pause when an action error occurs, provided that <strong>Fail on Error</strong> is selected in the configuration for the action.  This provides an operator the opportunity to triage the error and optionally resume the instance in the Instance Management UI.</p>\n<p>To access the Failure Handling functionality, select the <strong>Failure Handling</strong> tab of a design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"To_resume_the_deployment_of_paused_service_instance\">Failure handling options</h2>\n<p>The failure handling options available for each of the lifecycle stages are as below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provisioning</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fail on Errors</strong> - If selected, indicates that provisioning of this design should fail if an action error occurs during provisioning, and <strong>Fail on Error</strong> was selected for the action. <strong>On Failure</strong> lifecycle actions configured in the service design will run. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Terminated.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause on Errors</strong> - If selected, indicates that provisioning of this design should stop if an action error occurs during provisioning, and<strong> Fail on Error</strong> was selected for the action. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Pending. The provisioning can later be resumed or failed by an operator.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Modification</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fail on Errors</strong> - If selected, indicates that modification of this design should fail if an action error occurs during modification, and <strong>Fail on Error </strong>was selected for the action. <strong>On Failure</strong> lifecycle actions configured in the service design will run. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Active and will not be able to attempt another modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause on Errors</strong> - If selected, indicates that modification of this design should stop if an action error occurs during modification, and <strong>Fail on Error</strong> was selected for the action. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Active. The modification can later be resumed, reset, or failed by an operator.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cancellation</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fail on Errors</strong> - If selected, indicates that cancellation of this design should fail if an action error occurs during cancellation, and <strong>Fail on Error</strong> was selected for the action. <strong>On Failure</strong> lifecycle actions configured in the service design will run. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Canceled.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause on Errors </strong>- If selected, indicates that cancellation of this design should stop if an action error occurs during cancellation, and<strong> Fail on Error </strong>was selected for the action. A subscriber will see a subscription status of Canceled. The cancellation can later be resumed by an operator.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configure service instance transition timeout</h2>\n<p>The system polls for the status of a service instance during provisioning, modification, and cancellation for up to 24 hours. If an instance pauses during provisioning, modification, or cancellation, this 24 hour timeout may elapse before the instance completes its current lifecycle stage. For an instance being provisioned, if the timeout elapses the system will terminate the subscription. For an instance being modified, if the timeout elapses no further modifications of the subscription will be allowed.</p>\n<p>To increase the default timeout of 24 hours, perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the a control plane node.</li>\n<li>Run the following command, supplying the appropriate namespace for your environment:\n\t<pre>kubectl edit cm itom-xruntime-infra-config -n &lt;namespace&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Change the value of HCM_POLLING_WORKER_TIMEOUT to a number of hours of your choosing (a positive whole number greater than or equal to 1), then save the file.</li>\n<li>Run the following commands, supplying the appropriate namespace for your environment:\n\t<pre>kubectl rollout restart deployment itom-xruntime-platform -n &lt;namespace&gt;\n\nkubectl rollout restart deployment itom-xruntime-platform-offline -n &lt;namespace&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\">Note that if you will not be configuring designs to pause, it is recommended for performance reasons to leave HCM_POLLING_WORKER_TIMEOUT at its default setting.</div>\n<h2>Related Topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To add <strong>On Failure</strong> actions, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssdeditcomplifecycleactions\">Lifecycle actions for service design</a>.</li>\n<li>To configure the <strong>Fail on Error</strong> setting for action, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssdlcactionwiz\">Lifecycle action selection wizard for service design</a>.</li>\n<li>Service instances can be viewed on the Instance Management page.  For information on the actions that can be performed for paused service instances, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssoinstancemanagement\">Instance Management</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
