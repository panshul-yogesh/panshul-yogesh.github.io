An initial version is automatically created when you create a new design, and you can create as many versions of the design as you wish. While a new version inherits the display name and icon from the original design, you provide a version number (or string), description, and URL that are unique to a particular service design version. Once a version is created, you can use the <b>Designer</b> to create a hierarchy of service components. See the topic on Sequenced designer for more information.</p>\n<p>Any one or all versions of a design can be published. A design can't be edited after it's published.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<p>On the service design page, click the <span class=\"UIElementsgear icon\">gear icon</span> and select <b>Create New Version</b> to create a new version of the design. </p>\n<p>Provide the information in the following table and click <b>Save</b>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Based on Version</td>\n<td>The version of the service design from which this new version is copied.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Version</td>\n<td>Version of the new service design to be created.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Description of the new version of the design.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To know about the sequenced designer and designer controls, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/mgmtconssddesigner\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/MgmtConsSDDesigner\">Service designer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
