You will be able to perform further modifications to the subscription if required.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><strong>Note: </strong>As part of resetting an option property value, any service instance property that had a binding configured from this option property is also reset to the value it held prior to modification.  This may result in the service instance property value differing from the provisioned state of the resource associated with the service instance.  In such cases, an operator will need to manually adjust the actual resource state (for example, the configuration of a provisioned VM) to match the reset property values.</div>\n</li>\n<li><b>Fail modification</b>\n<p>Select this option to fail the modification if the modification can't be safely resumed or reset. The subscription will remain active but no further modification of the subscription will be allowed. In the Service Portal the actions dropdown will not have the option to modify the subscription. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><strong>Note: </strong>There is a short delay after a Reset Modification or Fail Modification before the Service Portal is updated to reflect that change.  In particular, the Actions dropdown in the Service Portal may take a minute to reappear.</div>\n<h3>Resume an instance paused during cancellation on successful completion of an action</h3>\n<p>For a service instance paused during cancellation, an operator, on the instance detail page, can resume cancellation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resume Cancellation</strong>\n<p>Select this option to resume cancellation.</p>\n<p>After resuming cancellation, the instance will initially return to a Canceling state and proceed with the remaining de-provisioning actions configured in the design in an attempt to bring the instance to a Canceled state.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resume a paused service instance using an API</h2>\n<p id=\"Details\">An instance that is paused after successful completion of an action can be resumed in the Deployment Operations UI or by invoking an API.<br/>\nTo resume the paused instance by invoking an API, issue an HTTP POST call, with an empty body, to the endpoint <code>https://&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;tenantId&gt;/dnd/api/service/instance/&lt;instanceId&gt;/resume</code>.</p>\n<p>Set the following headers in the HTTP call</p>\n<p><strong>Accept </strong>- application/json</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization </strong>- <code>&lt;Base64EncodedUserNameAndPassword&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To create the <code>&lt;Base64EncodedUserNameAndPassword&gt;</code> value, use a Base64 encoder to encode <code>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</code> (e.g. dndAdminUser:myPassword) for a user with permissions to resume service instances (such as the tenant admin user created for DND).</p>\n<p>To get the <code>&lt;instanceId&gt;</code>, go to <strong>Deployment Operations</strong> and select the service instance that you would like to resume. The browser URL will be in the format <code>https://&lt;hostname&gt;/dnd-operations-gateway/#/instance/&lt;instanceId&gt;/components</code>. The <code>&lt;instanceId&gt;</code> will be the value that immediately follows <code>/instance/ </code>in the URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>If the service instance URL is <code>https://myHost.myLab.net/dnd-operations-gateway/#/instance/2c90849e787b42d901787b790e4a6638/components</code>, the <code>&lt;instanceId&gt;</code> will be <code>2c90849e787b42d901787b790e4a6638</code>.</p>\n<p>If the instance was able to be resumed successfully, a 200 HTTP response and empty JSON body will be returned.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
