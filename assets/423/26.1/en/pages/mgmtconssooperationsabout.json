A subscription originates with a subscription request, which is a request for delivery of cloud services that are initiated by the subscriber (end-user) using a service catalog in the Service Portal. After a subscription request is approved, a service instance is created. Service instance artifacts are constructed during service deployment and updates service instances during service management. Service instances provide all details of the deployed service and its components; for example, provisioned IP details for a network segment component.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
