Please be aware that this operation can't be reverted, once you have enabled Native SACM, you can no longer use OPB to connect Service Management and UCMDB.</p>\n<p>Compared with the traditional Service Management-UCMDB integration through OPB, Native SACM brings the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up-to-date services and inventory</li>\n<li>Bi-directional data flow</li>\n<li>One service model and CI topology</li>\n<li>End-to-end lifecycle</li>\n<li>Auditing including federated attributes</li>\n<li>Enriched CI information</li>\n<li>Codeless configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_is_the_scope_of_Native_SACM\">Scope of Native SACM</h2>\n<p>Native SACM is implemented for the following Service Management record types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual Service</li>\n<li>Devices</li>\n<li>Service Component</li>\n<li>System Element</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Infrastructure and peripherals are currently not federated with UCMDB CIs.</p>\n<p>Once Native SACM is active, any objects created with one of these 4 record types are joined with an identical record in UCMDB. The Global-ID is used as the key.</p>\n<p>This means, whenever a new record is created in either Service Management or UCMDB, the same record will immediately appear on the other side. To test the Native SACM status, you can create a record in Service Management or in UCMDB and see how they are shown in both systems.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/nativesacmfunction\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/NativeSACMFunction\">CI type, attribute, and subtype federation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/deploynativesacm\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/DeployNativeSACM\">Deploy Native SACM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/cmsapigateway\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/CmsApiGateway\">UCMDB Gateway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/nativesacmstudio\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/NativeSACMStudio\">Configure Native SACM with Studio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/troubleshootnativesacm\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/TroubleshootNativeSACM\">Troubleshoot Native SACM</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
