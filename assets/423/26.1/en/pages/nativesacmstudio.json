There is now a new flag called “Federated Attribute.” Activate the flag and select a UCMDB attribute to associate with from the drop down list. The drop down list includes a list of UCMDB attributes for the federated CI types.</p>\n<p>You can also add these new attributes directly to the forms.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">In case newly created attributes in UD/UCMDB don't appear in the UD/UCMDB property name list, restart the API Gateway.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_federated_attributes_in_business_rules\">Use federated attributes in business rules</h2>\n<p>In Service Management business rules, you can use federated SACM fields/attributes from UCMDB and the changes made by business rules will be federated to UCMDB instantly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Example_1._Set_a_value_for_a_federated_SACM_field\">Example 1. Set a value for a federated SACM field</h3>\n<p>You can use the “Set Field” business rule for federated attributes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Example_2._Send_an_email_notification_using_a_federated_attribute\">Example 2. Send an email notification using a federated attribute</h3>\n<p>The following example of the <b>Send notification</b> action informs the CI owner when the Serial Number of the CI was changed.<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/e/e0/SMAX_Native_SACM_Notification.png\" title=\"/file/images/e/e0/SMAX_Native_SACM_Notification.png\"> <img alt=\"SMAX Native SACM Notification.png\" data-file-height=\"65\" data-file-width=\"650\" height=\"65\" src=\"../../../images/SMAX_Native_SACM_Notification_382426bd.png\" width=\"650\"/> </a><br/>\nFederated attributes can be also used in the email subject/body to send such data. To do this, simply add the required attributes into the notification templates as shown below.<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/6a/SMAX_Native_SACM_Func12.png\" title=\"/file/images/6/6a/SMAX_Native_SACM_Func12.png\"> <img alt=\"SMAX Native SACM Func12.png\" data-file-height=\"801\" data-file-width=\"1028\" height=\"801\" src=\"../../../images/SMAX_Native_SACM_Func12_29a4bb1a.png\" width=\"1028\"/> </a></p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_business_rules_to_modify_CI_relationships\">Use business rules to create or delete CI relationships</h2>\n<p>When Native SACM is enabled, you can open an Actual Service, Device, Service Component, or System Element record, click the <b>Related CIs</b> tab to view the CI topology federated from UCMDB. At the Service Management end, in addition to creating or deleting CI relationships in the service modeling widget, you can also create and run business rules in order to do so.</p>\n<p>Currently, the following actions are supported by business rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create <b>Composition</b>, <b>Containment</b>, or <b>Usage</b> relationships between two federated SACM records.</li>\n<li>Delete <b>Composition</b>, <b>Containment</b>, or <b>Usage</b> relationships between two federated SACM records.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Note:</b> CI relationships other than <b>Composition</b>, <b>Containment</b>, and <b>Usage</b> are also federated from UCMDB to SMA, however, they cannot be managed by SMAX business rules. </p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Although CI relationships only exist among SACM records, you can create a business rule in any records to create a CI relationship between SACM records. For example, you can create a business rule in the Request record type, which isn't a SACM record type, and use this business rule to create a CI relationship between a Device record and an Actual Service record, which are SACM records.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Create_a_CI_relationship_with_a_business_rule\">Create a CI relationship with a business rule</h3>\n<p>You can create a CI relationship with either a simple or \"If...Then\" rule.</p>\n<p>To create a CI relationship with a business rule:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a record type in Studio.</li>\n<li>On <b>Processes and Rules</b> tab, in a desired process event, click <b>Add,</b> select either <b>Simple rule</b> or <b>\"If...Then\" rule</b>.</li>\n<li>Select the <b>Create CI relationship</b> action.</li>\n<li>Enter the <b>If</b> condition with a DSL expression if it's an <b>\"If...Then\" rule</b>.</li>\n<li>In the <code>Create CI relationship of type &lt;relationship type&gt; from &lt;record type 1&gt; with ID &lt;id 1&gt; to &lt;record type 2&gt; with ID &lt;id 2&gt;</code> action, populate the following fields:\n\t<ul>\n<li><b>&lt;relationship type&gt;</b>: Select <b>Composition</b>, <b>Containment</b>, or <b>Usage</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;record type 1&gt;</b>: Select the source SACM record type, which can be <b>Actual Service</b>, <b>Device</b>, <b>Service Component</b>, or <b>System Element</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;id 1&gt;</b>: Select the source SACM record.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;record type 2&gt;</b>: Select the target SACM record type, which can be <b>Actual Service</b>, <b>Device</b>, <b>Service Component</b>, or <b>System Element</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;id 2&gt;</b>: Select the target SACM record.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When this rule is run, a CI relationship is created from record <b>&lt;id 1&gt;</b> to record <b>&lt;id2&gt;</b> in UCMDB.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Delete_a_CI_relationship_with_a_business_rule\">Delete a CI relationship with a business rule</h3>\n<p>You can delete a CI relationship with either a simple or \"If...Then\" rule.</p>\n<p>To delete a CI relationship with a business rule:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a record type in Studio.</li>\n<li>On <b>Processes and Rules</b> tab, in a desired process event, click <b>Add,</b> select either <b>Simple rule</b> or <b>\"If...Then\" rule</b>.</li>\n<li>Select the <b>Delete CI relationship</b> action.</li>\n<li>Enter the <b>If</b> condition with a DSL expression if it's an <b>\"If...Then\" rule</b>.</li>\n<li>In the <code>Delete CI relationship of type &lt;relationship type&gt; from &lt;record type 1&gt; with ID &lt;id 1&gt; to &lt;record type 2&gt; with ID &lt;id 2&gt;</code> action, populate the following fields:\n\t<ul>\n<li><b>&lt;relationship type&gt;</b>: Select <b>Composition</b>, <b>Containment</b>, or <b>Usage</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;record type 1&gt;</b>: Select the source SACM record type, which can be <b>Actual Service</b>, <b>Device</b>, <b>Service Component</b>, or <b>System Element</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;id 1&gt;</b>: Select the source SACM record.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;record type 2&gt;</b>: Select the target SACM record type, which can be <b>Actual Service</b>, <b>Device</b>, <b>Service Component</b>, or <b>System Element</b>.</li>\n<li><b>&lt;id 2&gt;</b>: Select the target SACM record.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When this rule is run, a CI relationship is deleted from record <b>&lt;id 1&gt;</b> to record <b>&lt;id2&gt;</b> in UCMDB.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Run_business_rule_through_a_record's_task_plan_to_create_or_delete_CI_relationships\"><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Run_business_rule_through_a_record.27s_task_plan_to_create_or_delete_CI_relationships\">Run business rule through a record's task plan to create or delete CI relationships</span></h3>\n<p>Business rules can also be run through a record's task plan. Therefore, it's also possible to create or delete a CI relationship by setting a business rule within a record's task plan when available. The syntax of the <b>Create CI relationship</b> and <b>Delete CI relationship</b> actions is the same as described above.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Only simple business rules are supported in task plans, if a condition needed, you can use the <b>Decision</b> field of the task plan.
