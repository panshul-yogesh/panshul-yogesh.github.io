  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>Observability helps you understand how a system works from the external. It allows you to easily troubleshoot and find the root cause of a problem by using three key signals: traces, metrics, and logs. </p>\n<h2>Traces</h2>\n<p>Traces give you a big picture of what happens when a user or an application makes a request across different services. You can use OpenTelemetry to collect the traces of the suite system. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/otelforsma\">Observe traces with OpenTelemetry</a>.</p>\n<h2>Metrics</h2>\n<p>A metric is a measurement of a service captured at runtime. Application and request metrics are important indicators of availability and performance. You can use Prometheus to collect statistical information about the CPU, memory, network I/O, and disk IO of the worker nodes, pods, and services in the suite system. Then, use Grafana to view data via charts and graphs that are unified into one dashboard (or multiple dashboards) for easier interpretation and understanding. See <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smamonitoring\">Observe metrics with Prometheus and Grafana</a>.</p>\n<h2>Logs</h2>\n<p>A log is a timestamped text record, either structured or unstructured, with metadata.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
