Because on-premises applications are located behind firewalls, initiating a connection from Service Management to an on-premises application isn't possible. Therefore you will require a \"bridge\" component.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Premises Bridge</strong> comprises of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-Premises Bridge Agent</strong> - The agent is a software component that's installed on the customer site and mediates between Service Management and an on-premises application. The agent initiates communications with Service Management to receive tasks from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Service Management On-Premises Bridge Service</strong> - The service is the entry point for submitting tasks by Service Management applications and for <strong>On-Premises Bridge</strong> Agents to request tasks. In addition to allowing execution of tasks on the agents, this layer is also responsible for the registration and management of agents, monitoring, secure communication with the agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\">\n<p><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are recommended to replace the out of the box certificate for Service Management Automation before using <strong>On-Premises Bridge</strong> agents and endpoints, refer to <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/replacecertforsma\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/ReplaceCertForSMA\">Replace the certificate for SMA</a>.</li>\n<li>A suite version update automatically upgrades <strong>OPB</strong> if a newer version of <strong>OPB </strong>is available. <strong>OPB </strong>should continue to work after you upgrade the suite to a new version. However, if <strong>OPB </strong>doesn't work after an upgrade, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbfailsaftersuiteupgrade\">OPB doesn't work after suite upgrade</a>.</li>\n<li>Auto-upgrade might block the util tools usage resulting in issues during the post upgrade process. If this issue occurs, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbpostupgradeissueafterautoupgrade\">post upgrade issues after OPB auto-upgrade</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbinstall\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/OpbInstall\">How to use <strong>On-Premises Bridge</strong> agents on Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbinstalllinux\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/OpbInstallLinux\">How to use <strong>On-Premises Bridge</strong> agents on Linux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbuseendpoints\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/OpbUseEndpoints\">How to use endpoints</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbsecurity\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/OpbSecurity\"><strong>On-Premises</strong> Bridge security additional information</a></li>\n<li>For information on how to use OPB endpoints of DND in dynamic option properties, see Use case: <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/opbendpointsusecase\">OPB endpoints of Design and Deploy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
