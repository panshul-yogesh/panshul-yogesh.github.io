with one click. An example is the Employee onboarding bundle, which is part of the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/newhirebundlehrsm\" title=\"New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle\">New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle</a> use case.</p>\n<p>The following Task Plan shows the various bundled offerings that are ordered when a manager submits a new employee onboarding request.</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/general/employee_onboarding_bundle_tasks.png\" title=\"/file/images/general/employee_onboarding_bundle_tasks.png\"> <img alt=\"Onboarding bundle tasks\" height=\"253\" src=\"../../../images/employee_onboarding_bundle_tasks_a7f70550.png\" width=\"800\"/> </a></div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-tip-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-tip-content\">By default, child bundled offerings inherit the settings (for example, the service desk group, assignee, owner, expert assignee, and expert group) defined in the parent offering bundle's task plan. These settings may differ from those defined in the standalone version of the offerings. To use the settings defined in a standalone offering instead of the offering bundle, clear the setting in the child offering in the offering bundle's task plan.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Surveys</h2>\n<p>The Human Resources Content package includes two surveys: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>HR Satisfaction Survey</li>\n<li>Employee Onboarding Bundle Satisfaction Survey. This survey is part of the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/newhirebundlehrsm\" title=\"New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle\">New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle</a> use case.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Email templates</h2>\n<p>The Human Resources Content package includes two email notification templates: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request to send the New Hire Swag Kit</li>\n<li>Update the status of Request to send the New Hire Swag Kit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These templates are part of the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/newhirebundlehrsm\" title=\"New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle\">New hire onboarding with the onboarding bundle</a> use case.</p>\n<h2>Smart Virtual Agent intents</h2>\n<p>The Human Resources Content package includes the following Virtual Agent intent: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lookup Employee Position Information​</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HR sample data package</h2>\n<p>A package of sample data for HR Service Management is also available out-of-the-box.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">Deploying the HR sample data package also enables the <strong>Enable a custom entity link between two out-of-the-box record types</strong> application setting. This is required in order to create links between offerings and locations.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information about how to deploy sample data, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sampledata\" title=\"Sample data\">Sample data</a>.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
