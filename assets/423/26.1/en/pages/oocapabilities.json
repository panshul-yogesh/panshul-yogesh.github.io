You can scale OO Central to reach high numbers of steps per second.</li>\n<li>Offers interactive execution and user interface (UI) embedding capabilities, which enable you to interact with the system in a much more usable fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"OO_Self-Service_X\">OO Central</h2>\n<p>OO Central is the runtime environment of OO. You can deploy it using the OO Helm Chart. It has a web based user interface (UI), that the administrators and end users can access. You can use OO Central for running flows, monitoring the various runs, and generating reports.</p>\n<p>OO Central has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Flow Execution</b>: OO Central offers execution capabilities for the deployed flows. Use a web based UI for executing the flows. The execution capabilities include browsing the flow library, launching an execution, and tracking that execution until its end.</li>\n<li><b>OO Administration</b>: OO Central offers administrators the means to manage the administration of OO from the system and operational perspectives. It covers areas such as setting permissions, defining system components, configuring LDAP, and more.</li>\n<li><b>Engine</b>: The engine works behind the scenes of Central. This is the back end component that processes and manages the entire flow execution. The engine manages the step execution, persistency, and manual interaction with the users.</li>\n<li><b>Scheduler</b>: OO Central includes an out-of-the-box scheduler. This enables the OO administrator to define various recurrence patterns for flow executions, to track, and manage them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Internal OO RAS</h2>\n<p>The internal OO RAS gets deployed automatically for each OO Central tenant in a tight coupling framework during the tenant deployment process. Note that for each Central tenant there is a corresponding out of the box RAS deployed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"OO_Workflow_Designer\">OO Workflow Designer</h2>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer is a web based environment for authoring flows. OO Workflow designer is available as a standalone product that you can deploy either on a Windows or Linux server. Flows are authored in the CloudSlang language and run in OO Central.</p>\n<p>OO Workflow Designer has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Web based UI</b>: OO Workflow Designer offers web access, which minimizes time to value and allows for simple management.</li>\n<li><b>Hybrid authoring interface- Textual and graphical</b>: OO Workflow Designer offers a graphical interface on top of the CloudSlang textual language. Every graphical change is immediately reflected in the underlying source code. The source code is visible from the OO Workflow Designer UI and you can control this source code in a <b>GIT</b> repository.</li>\n<li><b>Collaboration using GIT</b>: OO Workflow Designer allows collaboration using Git. This means that different authors (Central IT, line of business, operator, or application developer) can contribute to the authoring, while they can each work using their preferred tool. This can be either the OO Workflow Designer in which the authoring is graphical or via <b>ATOM</b> with the CloudSlang plugin which allows authoring the source files directly in a textual manner.</li>\n<li><b>Enhanced usability</b>: OO Workflow Designer and CloudSlang offer enhanced usability for authoring flows, with features such as default errors, sensitive system properties, decisions, input bindings, and direct deployment to OO Central.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"OO_Remote_Action_Service_(RAS)\">External OO Remote Action Service (RAS)</h2>\n<p>The OO RAS enables execution in remote data centers and networks. The RAS interacts with Central and polls it for operations to execute.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you set up the RAS to start the connection, you need to open ports for inbound communication only in Central. To achieve high availability of RASes, you simply add another RAS and point it to Central.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the RASes support a grouping mechanism, which enables you to correlate between a step in the flow and the type of the RASes that can execute this step. Therefore, the binding between the flow steps and the RASes is dynamic.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
