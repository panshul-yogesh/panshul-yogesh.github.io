  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>When you are importing an Aggregated Offering or simulating an Aggregated Offering import, you receive the following error message:</p>\n<p>\"Cannot import the Aggregated Offering because the Service Design does not exist.\"</p>\n<p>However, the Service Design does exist.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This error message is shown when any one of the following issues is detected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Service Design does not exist. In this scenario, the error message is precise.</li>\n<li>The last part of the provider's DND URL is wrong. For example, in a URL <em>https://itom-dnd-controller-svc:8444/dnd12345</em>, the last part <em>dnd12345 </em>is wrong. In this scenario, the same \"Cannot import the Aggregated Offering because the Service Design does not exist\" error message is shown, which is incorrect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resolution</h2>\n<p>When you receive this error message, please also check the DND URL and make sure it is correct.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
