The main benefits of Problem Management are improved service quality and reliability. As incidents are resolved, Service Management captures information about their resolution. Service Management uses this information to identify and resolve similar new incidents quickly, and to identify and fix the root cause of those incidents. Problem Management functions both reactively and proactively.</p>\n<p>Reactive Problem Management occurs when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Service Desk creates a problem record when there is a suspected (or detected) cause of one or more Incidents.</li>\n<li>A technical support group analyzes an incident and concludes that an underlying problem exists, or is likely to exist.</li>\n<li>You create a problem record when Service Management automatically creates an incident that's triggered by event or alert tools that detected an application or infrastructure fault.</li>\n<li>A supplier or contractor notifies the Service Desk that a problem exists that must be resolved.</li>\n<li>Regular analysis of incidents cause you to create a problem record that will cause the underlying fault to be investigated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reactive Problem Management resolves situations related to incidents. Reactive Problem Management is generally part of Service Operation, and is based on incident history.</p>\n<p>Proactive Problem Management identifies and solves issues and known errors before incidents occur. It's part of an initiative for continual service improvement. If you prevent incidents from happening, instead of reacting to them after they occur, an organization provides better service and higher efficiency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pminputoutput\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/pmInputOutput\">Problem Management input and output</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pmkpis\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/pmKPIs\">Problem Management KPIs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
