It enables you to form recommendations for improvement, maintain problem records, and review the status of corrective actions.</p>\n<p>Proactive Problem Management encompasses problem prevention, ranging from prevention of individual incidents, such as repeated difficulties with a particular system feature, to making higher level strategic decisions. The latter may require major expenditure to implement, such as investment in a better network. Problem prevention also includes proactively providing information to customers for future use. This communication reduces future requests for information and helps to prevent incidents caused by gaps in user knowledge or training.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pmitil\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/pmITIL\">Problem Management and ITIL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pminputoutput\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/pmInputOutput\">Problem Management input and output</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/pmkpis\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/pmKPIs\">Problem Management KPIs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
