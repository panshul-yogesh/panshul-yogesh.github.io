Service Management lists related records in a separate tab on the change form.</p>\n<p>The Related records tab enables you to review, create, and delete relationships among Service Management records. The bracketed number in the tab label displays the number of related records for the current record. There are two types of related records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Causes of the record are other changes, incidents, or problems that triggered the current record.</p>\n<p><b>Example</b>: An employee requests a certain change to an email account. The request triggered an incident because there is an email server outage. You can't complete the change until the incident status is closed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Effects of the record are other changes, incidents, or problems that are the result of the current record.</p>\n<p><b>Example</b>: The incident to repair the email server outage generates a problem record because this is a recurring outage that requires investigation. The problem resolution requires finding the root cause for the outage. When the outage is resolved, the incident is resolved. When the incident is resolved, the change request can be resolved.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resolving a request for change, an incident, or a problem can also involve hardware or software acquisition, or even require a new service to be available. Service Management also enables you to link asset records to changes, incidents, or problems.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"To_relate_records\">To relate records</h2>\n<div class=\"MCDropDownBody dropDownBody\">\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click the <b>Related records</b> tab to display a list of related records that are the <i>causes</i> of the current record or the <i>effects</i> of the current record.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In each section, the default sort order is first by record type, then by phase.
