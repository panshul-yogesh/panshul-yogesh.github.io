It's a process that minimizes the impact on customers of errors in infrastructure, services, and external events. The focus is to diagnose and rectify faults in the IT infrastructure, to obtain the highest possible stability in IT Service Delivery.</p>\n<p>In Service Management, a <span class=\"SAW_VariablesWorkflow\">workflow</span> is the end-to-end process of problem management, from the problem creation to the problem closure. The Service Management problem <span class=\"SAW_VariablesWorkflow\">workflow</span> includes all necessary steps to log and resolve a problem, and is a best practice for problem management, reflecting ITILv3 and process recommendations.</p>\n<p>The building blocks of the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesWorkflow\">workflow</span> are <i>metaphases</i>, <i>phases</i> and <i>transitions</i>. Service Management displays a graphic view of the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesWorkflow\">workflow</span> where you can see the current phase and the transitions that connect the current phase to all other phases.</p>\n<p>The Problem Management <span class=\"SAW_VariablesWorkflow\">workflow</span> contains four metaphases and six phases that lead to closure. When you update a record or assign a new status, the record can transition from one process phase to the next automatically.</p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/3/34/2018.08_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/PM/problem.png\" title=\"/file/images/3/34/2018.08_Helpcenter/Resources/Images/PM/problem.png\"> <img alt=\"problem.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"434\" src=\"../../../images/problem_a81cdb8b.png\" width=\"973\"/> </a></p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Metaphase:_Classification\">Metaphase: Classification</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Transition</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Log</td>\n<td>Automatic</td>\n<td>\n<p>The analyst enters detailed information about the problem.</p>\n<p><b>Next phase:</b> <b>Classify</b></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Classify</td>\n<td>Manual or automatic</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Problem Manager verifies the information provided, performs an initial analysis, and selects a category for the problem.
