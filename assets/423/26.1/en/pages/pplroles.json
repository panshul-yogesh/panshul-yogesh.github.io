  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n<p>Service Management has built-in roles according to industry best practice recommendations. Large companies might have several people assigned to the same role. Smaller organizations might have more than one role assigned to one person.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a role-based view of the organization ensures you adhere to the best practice model. You can adhere to the best practice model, no matter who you assign to the role or how you divide the responsibilities associated with the role. For example, if your company is large, you may have separate process designers and process owners assigned to each module. A smaller company might assign both roles to one person for each module.</p>\n<p>Permissions are controls within applications. When assigned, they enable you to complete certain Service Management tasks, such as adding updated information to a record. Permissions are an administrative strategy to control access to records and limit the number of people who can view, create, update, or delete records. Permissions to view particular data domains limit your ability to view only records that are tagged with those domains.
