For example, building an IT service is a program that consists of various projects to build, test, and release the IT service to production. Program management helps you to create, manage, and track your program list, maintain its content, and view the various aspects of the program that are aggregated from its content.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/programwflw\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/ProgramWflw\">Program workflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/createprogram\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/CreateProgram\">How to create a program</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/editprogram\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/EditProgram\">How to edit a program</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
