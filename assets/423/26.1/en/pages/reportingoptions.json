The Service Management application provides several methods for reporting on this data, including handling both operational and analytical type reports.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-important-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-important-content\">Service Management only supports direct access to the database for the PostgreSQL views. Unless directed by the Support as part of a case investigation or resolution, any other database access is not supported.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Due to the differences in technology and functionality between Service Manager and Service Management, automatic migration of existing reports is not possible. Therefore, it is important to understand the reporting options that Service Management provides in order to decide where and how the existing reporting requirements should be met.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Internal Reporting</h2>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>In-tool reports enable the view of the current and past status of the Service Management system. Data may be grouped or filtered to display specific information and data relevant to an agent or a supervisor. Reports may be saved publically and made available to agents with appropriate permissions or may be set for private use.</p>\n<p>An overview of Service Management in-tool reporting <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/report\" title=\"may be found here\">may be found here</a>.</p>\n<h2>External Reporting</h2>\n<p>Service Management built-in reports and dashboards provide a quick and useful way to define many simple operational and analytic reports. Meanwhile, complex reporting and KPI determination need advanced queries that involve multiple tables. These reports can be better addressed with external Business Intelligence tools crafted specifically for this purpose.</p>\n<p>The Service Management application provides two primary tools for exposing the relevant data to the external reporting tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PostgreSQL Views</li>\n<li>Business Intelligence Integration and APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br/>\nPostgreSQL Views</h3>\n<p><br/>\nThe internal representation of Service Management data is not formed in a way that is conducive to reporting tools. Instead, <em>PostgreSQL views</em> are generated automatically by the Service Management platform and allow external tools to view Service Management data in a standard relational format. By connecting a third-party tool, such as Microsoft Power BI or Tableau, directly to your Service Management data, PostgreSQL views may be utilized to generate complex and comprehensive database reports.</p>\n<p>Documentation that explains how to use PostgreSQL Views may be <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/reportpostgresqlviews\" title=\"found here\">found here</a>. Additionally, a video demonstration may be <a href=\"http://tiny.cc/SMAXpf20180411\" title=\"found here\">found here</a>.<br/>\n </p>\n<h3>Business Intelligence Integration</h3>\n<p>The Business Intelligence (BI) integration module enables an administrator to export fields and relationships for selected record types so that they may be imported into an external Business Intelligence tool. This allows great flexibility in exporting data for a third-party reporting tool. It is also useful for aggregating Service Management data with data contained in other parts of an organization.</p>\n<p>You can perform the intergration with either of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the BI integration API</li>\n<li>Use OData for BI integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details on the Business Intelligence Integration model may be <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/integrationbi\" title=\"found here.\">found here.</a></p>\n<div></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
