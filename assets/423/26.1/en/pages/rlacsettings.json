In these cases, the system behaves as follows. </p>\n<h4 lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><a id=\"Main_records\" name=\"Main_records\" title=\"Main records\"></a>Main records</h4>\n<p>Once RLAC is enabled on the main record type, the system enforces the access control on grids, forms, dashboards, EMS API calls, and more of the main records. However, when it comes to Entity Link fields and M2M fields, the system behaves as follows:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 0px;\"><li lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"margin-left: 28px; position: relative;\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Entity Link fields</strong>: The system bypasses RLAC for ENTITY_LINK fields on grids and forms of a main record. If a user has access to the main record, the user can view the existing ENTITY_LINK field value in the main record. For example, if a user has access to a request record but has no access to the service in the request record according to the RLAC configuration for Actual Service, the user can still see the service value in the request record, but can't open the Actual Service record.<br/>\n\tWhen the user adds an Entity_Link.Property column to a grid view, the system usually displays that column as <strong>empty</strong>, unless the property is ID or Display Label. The user needs to drill down to the details and view the other properties of the Entity Link record if the user has access to that record.<br/>\n\tFor API requests to the main record with Entity_Link.Property in the layout, if RLAC is enabled on that linked record type, the system may skip Entity_Link.Property. To obtain those properties, the user needs to send another API request to that linked record instead of through the main record.</li><li lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"margin-left: 28px; position: relative;\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>M2M fields</strong>: The system doesn't bypass RLAC for M2M fields on the grids and forms of the main record. For example, a Request record has three related incidents, and the user has access to only two of them according to the RLAC configuration for Incident. In this case, the user will see only two related incidents in the Request record. </li></ul>\n<h4 lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><a id=\"Parent_record_preview\" name=\"Parent_record_preview\" title=\"Parent record preview\"></a>Parent record preview</h4>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">If an agent user is the assignee of a task, a member of the assignment group of a task, or a delegate of an approval task, the user can still view the parent record of the task in the Preview pane, even if the user has no access to the parent record according to the RLAC configuration.</p>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">However, if the user drills down to the parent record details, the system still checks the RLAC filter for the current user.</p>\n<h3 lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><a id=\"Supported_field_types_in_the_RLAC_filter\" name=\"Supported_field_types_in_the_RLAC_filter\" title=\"Supported field types in the RLAC filter\"></a><span style=\"font-size: clamp(1.59375rem, 18.7895px + 1.39803vw, 2.125rem);\">Supported field types in the RLAC filter</span></h3>\n<p>Once the <strong>Enable Record Level Access Control (RLAC)</strong> option is enabled, you can select the following types of fields as a filter to control user access to records:</p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 0px;\"><li style=\"margin-left: 28px; position: relative;\">ENTITY_LINK </li><li style=\"margin-left: 28px; position: relative;\">ENTITY_LINK.ENTITY_LINK </li></ul>\n<p>These fields must have a reference to Person or Group in Studio.</p>\n<p>The following table gives some examples of the Request record type. </p>\n<table cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\">Field </th>\n<th scope=\"col\">Field type</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">RLAC description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assignee</td>\n<td>ENTITY_LINK</td>\n<td>Allows access to records where the current user is the assignee.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Assignment Group</td>\n<td>ENTITY_LINK</td>\n<td>Allows access to records where the current user is a member of the assignment group.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service.Owner</td>\n<td>ENTITY_LINK.ENTITY_LINK</td>\n<td>Allows access to records where the current user is the owner of the services in those records.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><a id=\"Using_indexed_fields_for_optimal_performance\" name=\"Using_indexed_fields_for_optimal_performance\" title=\"Using indexed fields for optimal performance\"></a>Using indexed fields for optimal performance</h3>\n<p>For performance considerations, we recommend that you use indexed fields for RLAC to increase the search speed of the system. </p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>This is required only when your access filter uses an ENTITY_LINK.ENTITY_LINK field.
