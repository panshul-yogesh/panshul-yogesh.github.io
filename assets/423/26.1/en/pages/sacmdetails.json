This includes specific information about each configuration item and the relationships between multiple CIs.</p>\n<p>There are multiple sub-processes within the overall SACM process, each with their own objectives:</p>\n<p>• Configuration Identification - define and maintain the underlying structure of the UD/UCMDB via the configuration model so it may contain all the information regarding configuration items. This includes specifying the attributes that describe all CI types and their components and defining their relationships to other CIs and CI types.</p>\n<p>• Configuration Control - ensure that no changes are made to configuration items (including adding new CIs) without the proper authorization and procedures and ensure that all changes made are properly recorded in the UD/UCMDB.</p>\n<p>• Configuration Verification and Audit - perform regular checks to ensure that the information in the UD/UCMDB accurately represents the configuration items installed in the production environment.</p>\n<p>Service Management provides the starting configuration model and may be used as the primary configuration management system. Alternatively, an external configuration management database may be used as the primary UD/UCMDB and integrate with Service Management to provide a copy of the CI information for all Service Management processes. This information is vital in many areas of Service Management, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<p>• Identifying the impact of requested changes</p>\n<p>• Providing diagnostic information to the service desk to help in resolve incidents or problems</p>\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/0/0d/SACM.gif\" title=\"/file/images/0/0d/SACM.gif\"> <img alt=\"SACM.gif\" border=\"0\" file=\"/mediawiki/images/0/0d/SACM.gif\" height=\"441\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/SACM_7eb122ca.gif\" style=\"width:124px;height:441px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"124\"/> </a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Using Service Asset and Configuration Management</h2>\n<p>Earlier, we saw how SACM and the service portfolio combined to give us a comprehensive picture of the services we provide and all the configuration items that make up those services. Defining our services and their components is the first step in our ongoing process. Ensuring that we keep those services running well and improving them over time will take more work.</p>\n<p>Service Management's service and configuration management module provides the repository for all the components (the configuration items) that make up our services. This repository supports the primary functions of the SACM process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configuration Identification - it gives us the ability to enter all the information for our configuration items, including specific information on the type of CI, all relevant attributes, and relationships to other CIs.</li>\n<li>Configuration Control - we need to ensure that no configuration items are added or changed without the required authorization and make sure that all changes are accurately recorded. This process is aided by change management to control changes to our environment.</li>\n<li>Configuration Verification and Audit - we need to check to ensure that the information we have in Service Management matches the actual state of our production environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>General information about SACM in Service Management can also be found in the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/getstartedsacm\" title=\"online documentation\">online documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Configuration Identification</h2>\n<p>Service Management allows us to identify and record our configuration items using its built-in hierarchical structure and also allows us to create relationships between the CIs. We've already looked at the top levels of this structure, but now we're ready to review each level in detail — as well as add the final level. Our final hierarchy includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actual services</li>\n<li>Service components</li>\n<li>System elements</li>\n<li>Devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This hierarchy is created by the relationships between the configuration items and follows a few rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each actual service comprises one or more service components</li>\n<li>Each service component contains zero or more system elements or devices</li>\n<li>Each system element contains zero or more devices</li>\n<li>Each system element can support zero or more service components</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Actual Services</h3>\n<p>We learned earlier that an actual service is an actual instance of a service definition that benefits our consumers. It's important to note that an actual service doesn't have to equate to a technical service. It could be something physical such as a mailbox.</p>\n<p>We can identify how we are using the actual service by specifying a specific subtype of either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business service</li>\n<li>Infrastructure service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where the first is a service that directly benefits our consumers, and the second is something that supports our business services but isn't something that our consumers interact with.</p>\n<p>Each actual service will contain one or more service components.</p>\n<h3>Service Components</h3>\n<p>The service component level allows us to divide our actual services into sections of distinct functionality. They are describable parts of our service. They aren't anything that can be discovered, but rather things that will be entered from our own knowledge of the services. For example, we might have a Payroll service that we want to split up into the actual application, the supporting database, and the web server. All of these things make up the Service, but they all have their own distinct function (and most likely have a different team in charge of them).</p>\n<p>Because we define them at whatever level we need, there aren't any pre-defined subtypes for service components. Instead, it's best to name them in a way that makes their functionality clear. In our Payroll example, we might name our service components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payroll Application</li>\n<li>Payroll Database</li>\n<li>Payroll Web Server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Service components should always relate to one or more actual services (we might have a single service component used by multiple services).</p>\n<p>In the opposite direction, service components are made up of either system elements or devices. It's our decision on which one to use, and the decision is based on the complexity of the service. If each of our components comprises only a few devices that would be the way to go. However, if we are talking about a great number of devices, and we can group those devices in a logical way, it's better to relate the service component to system elements (which are made up of a group of devices).</p>\n<h3>System Elements</h3>\n<p>A system element is a functionality supported by one or more devices. For example, a specific server is a device. When this server runs a specific set of applications, it becomes a web server. The web server is the system element. Unlike service components, these system elements are often discoverable using automated software tools.</p>\n<p>Service Management has pre-defined subtypes for system elements that help us define their actual functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running software</li>\n<li>Web server</li>\n<li>Database</li>\n<li>Virtualization</li>\n<li>Application server</li>\n<li>CI collection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we can always specify 'Other' if we have something that doesn't fit any of those categorizations.</p>\n<p>Each system element can support multiple service components and is comprised of one or more devices.</p>\n<h3>Devices</h3>\n<p>We've taken a look at the higher level configuration items: services, service components, and system elements. Now we need to go an extra level so we can define the actual devices that work together to provide the functionality of those components and elements.</p>\n<p>Service Management has built-in definitions for the physical (and virtual) devices we find in our IT infrastructure. While we can extend the list of device subtypes, I think the out-of-the-box list will be sufficient for now. We can always come back and add more if we discover the need.</p>\n<h2>Using Discovery for Configuration Control, Verification, and Audit</h2>\n<p>Having the configuration item information in Service Management gives us the ability to follow our configuration control process (with change management as a primary driver) and the verification and audit processes. But how do we get the information into the system to begin with? I guess we could hire a bunch of interns to walk around asking questions and entering the information manually, but that doesn't seem efficient.</p>\n<h3>Universal Discovery</h3>\n<p>An automated discovery product gives us a means to populate our configuration item information. There are multiple products on the market that use a variety of methods to capture information about our service assets and configuration items and map the relationships between these elements. Some of the most advanced versions of these tools can even discover and model our business services and applications. Universal Discovery is one of these highly advanced discovery tools we will use to model and discover the IT infrastructure we use to deliver our services to our customers.</p>\n<p>Unlike network-oriented discovery products or asset inventory products, Universal Discovery explores assets and configuration items (CIs) from layer 2 through layer 7 of the Open Systems Interconnection model, as well as deep-device and application-specific information. It also explores and maps the relationships between these elements beyond the traditional uses and contains relationship types.</p>\n<p>Now, I really don't understand all of the words in the above paragraph. I just copied what was in the product brochure. But what I do know is how excited our IT personnel were when they saw what the product could do and how quickly and easily it created a detailed map of our infrastructure. Now what we need is a place to put all of this data.</p>\n<h3>UCMDB</h3>\n<p>Universal CMDB is a configuration management database solution which — in concert with Universal Discovery — collects and manages accurate and updated business service definitions, associated infrastructure relationships and detailed information on the assets, and acts as a central component in many of the key processes in an IT organization. The UCMDB is the central storage component for our configuration items and handles the reconciliation needed when using multiple data sources or discovery tools.</p>\n<p>UCMDB is a default tool in OpenText Service Management, so we can always have the latest up-to-date information at our fingertips. Whether we are looking at incidents, changes, or other processes inside of Service Management, the UCMDB will provide all the supporting information our agents need to make the correct decisions.</p>\n<p>If our agents need any specific information or details, they can launch the UCMDB browser with a single click. As an example, our agent might want to see what a certain configuration item looked like in the past. As the information inside of the standard agent interface reflects the latest status of a CI, launching out to the UCMDB browser would allow the agent to investigate the configuration over time, which might help them when investigating an ongoing incident.</p>\n<h2>Setting up SACM</h2>\n<p>There isn't much that we need to do in order to \"set up\" the SACM module. Service Management defines all the configuration item types and attributes for us, and the UCMDB is ready to go out of the box.</p>\n<p>There are only two options we need to concern ourselves with, which are both specified in the 'SACM configuration' option from the main SACM screen.</p>\n<p>First, we need to specify whether we want our agents to have the authority to launch a remote desktop connection when viewing the information of a Windows computer (if they are also on a Windows computer). If we do, we need to set the 'Enable RDP' check-box to true. This will add a 'Remote Connection' button to the toolbar when viewing a Windows computer.</p>\n<p>Second, if we are taking full advantage of the UCMDB, we need to enable it and tell Service Management the URL of the UCMDB browser. This will add a button to the configuration items to show their information in the UCMDB browser.</p>\n<p>The out-of-the-box integration inside of Service Management will synchronize the configuration items based on predefined mapping information. This should be enough to meet our process needs, but if it isn't we can create our own customized mapping and bring in the exact attributes we need.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
