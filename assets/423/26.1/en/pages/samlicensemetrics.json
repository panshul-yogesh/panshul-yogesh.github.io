For a publisher, products are licensed under one or more metrics. Generally, you can measure the use of products licensed under the same metric with the same license rule.</p>\n<p>Before creating a license rule, you need to manage the license metrics on the <b>Licence Metrics</b> page. All publishers with license metrics are listed in the left panel. The area on the right displays the license metrics under a selected publisher. The <b>System</b> tag indicates that the license metric is out of the box (OOTB). You can't edit or delete an OOTB license metric.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Create_a_new_license_metric\">Create a new license metric</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <b>Licence Metrics</b> page, click <b>New</b>.</li>\n<li>In the <b>New License Metric</b> dialog box that appears, set all required fields.\n\t<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Publisher</td>\n<td>From the drop-down list, select a publisher for whom you want to create the new license metric.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>Specifies the metric name. You can refer to the publisher's documentation for this field.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Code</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specifies a unique string to identify the license metric. We recommend that you use the <i>&lt;Publisher&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;License metric&gt;</i> format. For example, use <i>MS_SERVEROS_CORECAL</i> to refer to the core/CAL license of the Microsoft operating system.</p>\n<p><b>Notes:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only alphanumeric characters and underscores (_) are allowed for the <b>Code</b> field.</li>\n<li>Don't use \"SYS\" as the prefix for the value of the <b>Code</b> field.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Calculation unit</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specifies the object based on which license compliance is calculated. Optional values include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Operating system environment</b>: This option passes the data of physical and virtual OSEs that have the product installed to the license rule for compliance calculation.</li>\n<li><b>Installation</b>: The data retrieval mechanism for this value is the same as that for the <b>Operating system environment </b>value.</li>\n<li><b>Host</b>: This option passes the physical device and all virtual machines installed on this physical device to the license rule as a whole for compliance calculation. Regardless of physical and virtual machines, only those installed with the product are passed to the license rule.</li>\n<li><strong>Person</strong>: This option is used for the consumption calculation of user-based licenses. SAM calculates license consumption based on the license entitlement information in Service Management and device information from UCMDB. The device information includes both physical OSEs and virtual OSEs as long as they have the product installed.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edit_a_license_metric\">Edit a license metric</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a metric.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> in the side pane on the right.</li>\n<li>Make the changes as needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a key element, the license metric is referenced by multiple objects. For data integrity, you can't change the publisher of a license metric. Instead, you can add a new license metric for the desired publisher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Delete_a_license_metric\">Delete a license metric</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a metric.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Delete</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that a license metric used in the calculation result can't be deleted. This is because a compliance calculation result can't be removed.</p>\n<p>If a license metric is only referenced by a license rule or used in license model normalization, you can remove this metric after decoupling all its relationships. To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <b>License Rules</b> or <b>License Models</b> page.</li>\n<li>Locate the license rules or normalized license models that are using the target license metric, and then decouple its relationships.</li>\n<li>Delete the license metric.</li>\n</ol>\n<div></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
