The <b>Sample Data</b> menu option (under <b>Administration &gt; Utilities &gt; Data Deployment</b>) appears only if you have the Tenant Admin role.</p>\n<p>There are many types of sample data. The following are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sample users, groups, and locations</li>\n<li>A sample service catalog that contains categories, services, and offerings</li>\n<li>Sample knowledge articles</li>\n<li>Sample IT records such as user requests, incidents, changes, and problems</li>\n<li>Assets and configuration management records such as services, assets, and devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data imported as sample data is indistinguishable from data entered into the system.</p>\n<p>Once the sample data is deployed, the button on the Sample Data page becomes disabled.</p>\n<p>The Tenant Admin receives a notification via email when a new tenant is created. This mail includes a link to the Sample Data page where the data can be deployed onto the new tenant.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-caution-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-caution-content\">\n<ul>\n<li>If you deploy the sample data, it can't be undeployed. You can delete individual pieces of data, such as knowledge articles and records, but you can't reverse the deployment. In addition, you need to take care of the sample data in future upgrades as the system won't upgrade it automatically.</li>\n<li>We recommend that you deploy all the sample data that you need at the same time.</li>\n<li>If any pods restart during the data deployment, some relationships may not be created. These will have to be created manually.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
