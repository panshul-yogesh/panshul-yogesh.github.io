This is a mechanism in which a single action of user authentication and authorization can permit a user to access all systems that support LW-SSO. For example, if users have logged onto another product web client that has LWSSO enabled, they can enter the OO Workflow Designer application directly, bypassing the OO Workflow Designer logon screen.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Security</td>\n<td>The processes and mechanisms by which computer-based equipment, information, and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change, or damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication</td>\n<td>The process of identifying an individual, usually based on a user name and password, or certificate.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Encryption</td>\n<td>A way to enhance the security of a message or file by scrambling the contents so that it can be read only by someone who has the right encryption key to encode it. For example, the TLS protocol encrypts the communication data.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
