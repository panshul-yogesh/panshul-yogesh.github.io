As a Service Management administrator, you can change the default behavior of these built-in target definitions by editing the Service Level Target definition records.</p>\n<h2>Calculations</h2>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Service Management runs a backend scheduler job to calculate the elapsed time for each Service Level Target. The calculation frequency varies—Service Management decides the next calculation time by considering two factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an interval that varies according to the time left or overdue compared with the target time of a Service Level Target. The less time left or overdue, the smaller interval. The smallest interval is one minute, and the largest is one day. </li>\n<li>an interval that is equal to one percent (1%) of the duration of the SLT definition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Service Management calculates two next calculation time values according to the two intervals, and chooses whichever is sooner.</p>\n<p>Service Management calculates duration from the time the Start SLT rule runs. For details about how Service Management calculates the durations for Service Level Targets, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/sltduration#Duration\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/SLTduration\">Service Level Target duration calculation details</a>.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the factors that affect the SLT calculations, which are described below.</p>\n<h3>SLT-related fields in a record</h3>\n<p>If you update any SLT-related fields (<strong>SLA</strong>, <strong>OLA</strong>,<strong> Service</strong>, <strong>Priority</strong>, the assignment group, or<b> </b>the customer field) of a record, Service Management applies the changes correctly to any calculation in progress. For example, if you change the priority in an incident from \"Slight disruption\" to \"Severe disruption\", Service Management adjusts the calculation in progress to apply this new value.</p>\n<p>If the <strong>Priority</strong> field is empty, the target type is shown as <strong>Not defined</strong>. </p>\n<h3>Actual service or offering in a record</h3>\n<p>If you change the actual service or offering assigned to a record, the Service Level Target definition might change or even become obsolete. If the Service Level Target definition changes, the Service Level Target calculation in progress is cleared, and any new or changed target definition calculations begin. In this case, the time already elapsed may or may not be included in the new target definition calculations, according to whether the record's workflow process is changed or not.</p>\n<table cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\">Condition</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">Time already elapsed is included in new calculations?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The record's workflow process has not changed</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The record's workflow process has changed</td>\n<td>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>For example, if you change the offering on a request, and as a result the request has changed from a Service request to a Support request and the SLT is reinitialized. In this case, the time already elapsed before the offering is changed is not included in the new SLT calculations.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Process type of a record</h3>\n<p>If you change the process type of a record (for example, you change a support request to a service request), the SLT calculation is reinitialized and the already elapsed time is not included in the new calculation.</p>\n<h3>Timezone and work schedule</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time zone and work schedule</strong>: Service Management calculations take into account the time zone and work schedule specified in the Service Level Target definition. </li>\n<li><strong>Applying changes to an SLT definition</strong>: When you make changes to a Service Level Target definition, the changes require an update to every record using that target definition. The changes will take effect automatically within 24 hours. Alternatively, you can click <b>Apply now</b> at the top of the Service Level Management page or the Time Period Management page to begin updating the Service Level Target definitions immediately. The amount of time to complete the update depends on the number of affected records. If one of those records is open, click <b>Refresh</b> to see the updates. If you make additional changes to a Service Level Target definition after applying the changes manually, the <b>Apply now</b> button will reappear after a few minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New chat request</h3>\n<p>When a new chat request is submitted, the elapsed target duration is reset.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notifications\">Notifications</h2>\n<p>Service Management sends email notifications as a Service Level target approaches a breach threshold.</p>\n<p>The default email template includes the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service</li>\n<li>Category</li>\n<li>Priority</li>\n<li>Status</li>\n<li>Description</li>\n<li>SLT type</li>\n<li>SLT name</li>\n<li>SLT target time</li>\n<li>Group</li>\n<li>Offering</li>\n<li>Agreement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notifications for incidents</p>\n<table class=\"contenttable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Recipients</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"3\">SLT breach -
