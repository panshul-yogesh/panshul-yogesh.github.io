As a result of organizations moving towards digitization, and the way in which users engage with technology and services in non-work contexts, there has been a shift in how employees and IT work together. However, this new synergy brings requirements that a classically deployed, stable legacy service management architecture cannot easily meet. As your organization considers a digital transformation strategy that will enable it to operate with greater ease, efficiency, productivity, and overall agility, and to keep users happy and engaged, your IT service management processes must adopt these modern capabilities. </p>\n<p>We will help you achieve that when transitioning to Service Management. This documentation will focus on the evolution process when coming from the Service Manager, but the approach is general enough that with small modifications it can be used for any existing service management application.</p>\n<p>In this section, you will find guidance, best practices, and checklists for evolving to Service Management. The overall direction of the evolution process is similar to that of a new implementation, so it is highly recommended to follow overall guidelines and steps from the <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/implementationchecklist\" title=\"Implementation Checklist\">Implementation Checklist</a> in the Key concepts guide.</p>\n<p>The biggest change from a new Service Management implementation is that much of the data needed already exists in the current service management system. The Evolving to Service Management documentation focuses on this existing data, as well as specific differences regarding this data between the two products. The following sections will provide guidance and best practices on dealing with this existing documentation and how it can be best integrated into the new Service Management implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_start\" title=\"Before you start\">Before you start</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_fromsm\" title=\"Evolving from Service Manager\">Evolving from Service Manager</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/differencesfromsm\" title=\"Differences from Service Manager\">Differences from Service Manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_environment\" title=\"Collecting Environment Information\">Collecting Environment Information</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_masterdata\" title=\"Core Data and the SMA Evolution Toolkit\">Core Data and the Integration Studio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/dualmode\" title=\"SMAX/SM Dual Mode\">Service Management/SM Dual Mode</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/servicesandtheservicecatalog\" title=\"The Service Catalog\">The Service Catalog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_knowledge\" title=\"Knowledge Articles\">Knowledge Articles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/smaev_reporting\" title=\"Reporting Options\">Reporting Options</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/usingsaminsmax\" title=\"Using Software Asset Management in SMAX\">Using Software Asset Management in Service Management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/wayofworking\" title=\"Best Practices\">Best Practices</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/workingwithforms\" title=\"Working with Forms\">Working with Forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/enhancingworkflowwithmodels\" title=\"Enhancing Workflow with Models\">Enhancing Workflow with Models</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/requestvsincident\" title=\"Request vs. Incident\">Request vs. Incident</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
