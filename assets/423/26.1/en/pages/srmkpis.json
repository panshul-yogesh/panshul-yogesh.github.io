To visualize trend information, it's useful to graph KPI data periodically. In addition to the data provided by Service Management, you may need additional tools to report on all of your KPI requirements.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of requests closed within Service Level Target time</td>\n<td>The number of requests that are closed within the Service Level Target time, relative to the number of all requests closed, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentage of rejected requests</td>\n<td>The number of resolved requests that were rejected by the user as not solved</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backlog of requests</td>\n<td>The number of requests that aren't yet closed, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total number of requests</td>\n<td>Total number of new requests, in a given time period.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These are common metrics, however, each standards organization has their own recommendations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ITIL_V3_KPIs\">ITIL V3 KPIs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of requests (as a control measure).</li>\n<li>Breakdown of requests at each stage. For example, the number of requests logged, work in progress, and closed.</li>\n<li>Size of current request backlog.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of major requests.</li>\n<li>Mean elapsed time to achieve request resolution or a workaround by impact.</li>\n<li>Percentage of requests handled within the target response time. You can specify request response-time targets using defined Service Level Targets.</li>\n<li>Average cost for each request.</li>\n<li>Number of requests reopened and as a percentage of the total.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of requests incorrectly assigned. Number and percentage of requests incorrectly categorized.</li>\n<li>Number and percentage of requests resolved remotely with no on-site visit required.</li>\n<li>Number of requests handled by each request offering.</li>\n<li>Breakdown of requests by time of day, which helps pinpoint peaks and ensure matching of resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>COBIT 4.1 recommends that you measure these performance indicators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percent of incidents resolved within the time period specified</li>\n<li>Percent of incidents reopened Average duration of incidents by severity</li>\n<li>Percent of incidents that require local support (field support or an on-site visit)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Useful_request_fields\">Useful request fields</h2>\n<p>The following fields may also be useful in tracking your request KPIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>First touch.</b> Indicates that the record was resolved by the first owner, within the first hour.</li>\n<li><b>First line.</b> Indicates that the record was resolved by the first Service Desk assigned, without the need for any escalation.</li>\n</ul>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\"></th>\n<th scope=\"col\">First touch</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">First line</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">Service Request</th>\n<td>\n<p>The First Touch flag is automatically set to <strong>true </strong>when the record is opened.
