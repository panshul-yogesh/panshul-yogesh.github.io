This issue occurs if you have entered the grid through tiles on the SACM landing page.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>To work around this issue, you can enter the grid by selecting the menu item on the SACM page, now, the added filter won't disappear after you drill down into a record's detail page and then click the <strong>Back</strong> button to return.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can define a customized view, and click the view to recover the filter after going back from any record detail pages.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
