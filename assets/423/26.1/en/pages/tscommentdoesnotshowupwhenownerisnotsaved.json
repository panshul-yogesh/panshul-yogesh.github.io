Instead, a \"Request has been assigned\" comment appears in the email notification.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>Before setting and saving an owner, the system doesn’t know the recipient of the email notification and therefore can’t add the comment. Instead, the default \"Request has been assigned\" comment is put in the email notification.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Make sure an owner has been assigned to the record and click <strong>Save</strong>. Then, add your comment to the discussion.<br/>\n </p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
