Validate the support matrix before you perform any Kubernetes upgrade on your provider side.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case the Kubernetes version listed in the support matrix for the current release is not longer supported by the provider, contact OpenText support for guidance. For example, if GCP supports GKE v1.29 and above, but the current release you plan to upgrade to only supports GKE v1.27 and v1.28, you should seek support.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">The Kubernetes upgrade will cause system downtime. Perform the upgrade in a planned maintenance window. For EKS only, make sure you use <b>Force update</b> as the update strategy, and it takes over an hour of update time for each version update and there are about 15 minutes of downtime during the update.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For a managed Kubernetes deployment, perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade Kubernetes by following the official documentation of the cloud provider: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-upgrades\" title=\"GCP\">GCP</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster\" title=\"AKS\">AKS</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html\" title=\"EKS\">EKS</a>.</li>\n<li>After upgrading the Kubernetes cluster, make sure all pods are up and running. If the <b>infra-rabbitmq-&lt;n&gt;</b> (&lt;n&gt;=0, 1, or 2) pod isn't ready, see <a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/rabbitmqnotstart\" title=\"RabbitMQ isn't ready\">RabbitMQ isn't ready</a> for a solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
