The image registry is a local registry on your cluster nodes or an external registry, such as your enterprise repository.</p>\n<p>To upload the images:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log on to the bastion node where you downloaded or copied the images.</li>\n<li>Run the following command to the <code>$CDF_HOME/scripts/</code> directory:\n\t<pre>cd $CDF_HOME/scripts</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Run the following command to upload the suite images to the local registry:\n\t<pre>./uploadimages.sh [-r &lt;image repository URL&gt; -u &lt;username&gt; -d &lt;image download directory&gt; -o &lt;org name&gt;]</pre>\n<br/>\n\tWhere,\n\t<p><em>&lt;image repository URL&gt;</em>: Specify the <code>-r</code> option if you want to upload the images to an external registry other than the local registry.</p>\n<p>Replace &lt;<i>username</i>&gt; with the registry username. Use the <strong>registry-admin</strong> user for the local registry. The local registry refers to the default registry or the registry URL that's <strong>localhost:5000</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you don't specify the credentials here, you can specify when prompted while running the command.</p>\n<p><em>&lt;image download directory&gt;</em>: The directory where the container images will get downloaded. The default value is /var/opt/cdf/offline. The <code>-d</code> option is the image directory where you placed the images you have downloaded. Specify the <code>-d </code> option if the images aren't available in the <code>/var/opt/cdf/offline/</code> directory. You can use the <code>-d</code> option multiple times when the images are in different directories. However, if you have specified the <code>-l</code> option to \"false\", then you can only specify one image directory. The images can be the images download by the <strong>downloadimages.sh</strong>. Only the .tar, .tgz, and .tar.gz images are supported. Make sure the image file type matches the file extension. </p>\n<p><em>&lt;org name&gt;</em>: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is <strong>hpeswitom</strong><code>.</code> This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.</p>\n\tTo see the full list of options for the <strong>uploadimages.sh</strong> command, run the following command:\n\n\t<pre>./uploadimages.sh -h </pre>\n\tFor example:\n\n\t<pre>./uploadimages.sh -y -c 4 -u registry-admin</pre>\n<p><br/>\n\tThe <code>-p</code> option is the password of the <strong>registry-admin</strong> user. The initial value of the <strong>registry-admin</strong> password is the password you set while you run the <code>install</code> to install OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT). You can also change the <strong>registry-admin</strong> password with the script <code>$CDF_HOME/scripts/updateLocalRegistryInfo.sh</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"Admonition_Note\"><span class=\"autonumber\">Note</span><br/>\n\tBy selecting the -p option, you are disabling or bypassing security features, thereby exposing the system to increased security risks. By using this option, you understand and agree to assume all associated risks and hold <code>OpenText</code> harmless for the same.<br/>\n<code>OpenText</code> encourages you to use some other password options, which aren't provided by <code>OpenText</code>. By implementing the -p option, you may expose the system to increased security risks. You understand and agree to assume all associated risks and hold <code>OpenText</code> harmless for the same.
