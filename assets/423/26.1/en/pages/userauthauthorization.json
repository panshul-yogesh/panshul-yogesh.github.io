Normally, the tenant admin assigns roles to groups and then adds users to groups so that users can inherit the role permissions from the groups.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition\"><div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div><div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\"><div>Don’t assign the <b>Business Intelligence Integration</b> or <b>OPB Remote Agent</b> role to account users because it will prevent them from logging in to Agent Interface and Service Portal. </div></div></div>\n<p>This topic explains how the solution works, the best practices for using the solution, and how to migrate existing tenants to this solution. </p>\n<h2><a id=\"How_it_works\" name=\"How_it_works\" title=\"How it works\"></a>How it works</h2>\n<p>The following explains how the solution works.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"Roles\" name=\"Roles\" title=\"Roles\"></a>Roles</h3>\n<p>In the agent interface, roles have an attribute named Application.

When the suite admin enables Native SACM for the tenant, Service Management automatically replicates the seeded UD/UCMDB OOTB roles and the UD/UCMDB admin group from IdM to the agent interface.

A <strong>Migrate</strong> button is available from Suite Administration: either from the tenant record or from the Configurations tab. You can start the migration process with one click. This process replicates authorization data between IdM and the tenant (the agent interface) so that both sides store the same authorization data. This is a one-time process. Once the two sides store the same data, whenever you create new authorization data from the agent interface, the new data is replicated to IdM simultaneously.
