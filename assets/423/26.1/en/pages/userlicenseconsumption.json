Each named license or concurrent license has a capacity value, which indicates how many users (named users or concurrent users) can consume the license:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The capacity of a named license is in a one-to-one ratio to the number of users. </li>\n<li>Concurrent licenses are also known as group licenses. They're floating licenses for all agent users. Once a concurrent license is released, another user can consume it. The number of users that are entitled to use a concurrent license can be more than its capacity. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>License assignment</h2>\n<p>In the agent interface, the <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>People</strong> page displays all licenses assigned to the tenant. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>When assigning licenses to a user, the tenant admin can select from all licenses assigned to the tenant. This means the tenant admin can assign multiple licenses to a user.  </li>\n<li>For a user to consume a named license, the tenant admin must manually assign the license to the user. In this case, the system doesn't automatically assign any concurrent licenses to the user when the user logs in to the agent interface.</li>\n<li>If an agent user has no named license assigned, the system automatically assigns all concurrent licenses of the tenant to the user when the user logs in to the agent interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>License consumption</h2>\n<p>If an agent user has both named licenses and concurrent licenses assigned, the user consumes a named license after login. </p>\n<p>If a user has no named license assigned, the user consumes a concurrent license. Since all concurrent licenses of the tenant are assigned to each agent user, if one concurrent license runs out of its capacity, the user consumes the next concurrent license. </p>\n<h2>License release</h2>\n<p>The system releases a logged-in user's license after the user has been idle for a period of time or after the user clicks the Logout button.  </p>\n<h3>Inactivity</h3>\n<p>The license release time is 30 minutes. This means when a logged-in user has been inactive for 30 minutes, the system automatically releases the user's license. For example, if the user starts an idle period at 1:00 PM, the license is ready to be released at 1:30 PM. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, there is a background cron job running every 15 minutes to release licenses. The exact time to release a user's license also depends on the time when the job runs. For the example above, the user's license will be released between 1:30 PM ~ 1:45 PM. </p>\n<h3>Logout</h3>\n<p>After an agent user clicks the Logout button, the system releases the user's license immediately. </p>\n<div class=\"admonition\">\n<div class=\"admonition-icon admonition-note-icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"admonition-content admonition-note-content\">\n<p>  Once a user is deleted in Suite Administration, the user will become a contact in the tenant after two hours at most. Then, the related licenses can be re-assigned to other users three days later. Do not delete the contact within three days, or the license will not be released.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Related topics</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/userslicenses\" title=\"How to assign licenses to users\">How to assign licenses to users</a></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
