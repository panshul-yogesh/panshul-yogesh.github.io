  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><p>For an aggregated offering of a DND service design, if you try to add approval policy for user operations and retrieve the user operations in the aggregated offering page, it lists repeated user operation names on components. Because of this, the user is unable to add distinct approval policy for the same user operations defined on different components.</p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>This issue occurs if the design has multiple components and they're associated with the same Resource Offering (RO).</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The following workaround avoids reuse of the same RO on multiple components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Service Designer</strong> and select the service design that contains multiple components associated with the same Resource Offering (RO).</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Resource Offerings</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Select the Resource Offering associated with multiple components.<br/>\n\tThe Resource Offering page appears.</li>\n<li>Click the gear icon, select <strong>Save As </strong>and then click <strong>Save</strong>.<br/>\n\tThe newly created RO appears.</li>\n<li>On the newly created RO, click the <strong>User Operations</strong> tab.<br/>\n\tThe <strong>User Operations</strong> page appears.</li>\n<li>Delete the user operations and add the same user operations again.<br/>\n\tMake sure the mapping between properties of user operations remains the same as before.</li>\n<li>Attach this RO to other component where the user wants to reuse the existing RO.</li>\n<li>Repeat this procedure for each component of the design.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
