For example, blocking after a number of failed attempts.</p>\n<p>When using MS SQL, it's possible to work with either database authentication or with OS authentication. It's recommended to work with OS authentication, where this is possible. For example, it's possible to use Windows authentication to access Microsoft SQL Server databases.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
