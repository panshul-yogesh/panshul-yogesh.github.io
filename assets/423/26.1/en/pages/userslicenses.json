  "content": "<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p><div></div>\n<p>All users must have a license assigned to log in to Service Management. When a tenant is created, the tenant license is automatically assigned to the tenant administrator. This tenant license includes a fixed number of individual license slots. The tenant administrator can then assign other users to the license up to the capacity of the license. Each user acquires a license slot when they log in.</p>\n<p>There are three types of licenses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Named license</b> is a license assigned to a particular user.</li>\n<li><b>Concurrent license</b> may be shared by multiple users who are assigned to this type of license. Only one user can be logged on under each license slot of the concurrent license at a given time. The number of concurrent license slots is determined at the tenant level.</li>\n<li><b>Multi-tenant Named Users license</b> is the license used for accessing other tenants in a multi-tenant environment. In terms of the license, it functions the same as a named license and not a concurrent license.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The type of license is determined at the time of the tenant creation and the included license slots are of the same type.</p>\n<p>A user may be assigned to multiple licenses. When attempting to log in, Service Management verifies that at least one of the user's licenses is valid (not expired) and updates the number of available slots in that license (reduced by one). Access is denied to users who don't have valid licenses. If a tenant has a license for Service Management, all the users of the tenant are automatically granted access to Service Portal.</p>\n<p>To assign users to licenses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the <span class=\"SAW_VariablesMain_menu\">main menu</span>, select <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People</b>.</li>\n<li>Select the required user.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> in the right pane.</li>\n<li>In the <b>License</b> field, select the licenses to assign to the user.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mw-headline\">An admin user can assign licenses to users. For each assigned license, a yellow icon is displayed at the top of the people admin page indicating the number of users that have an assigned license. The caption next to the icon indicates both the count of users with assigned licenses—whether automatically upon their successful initial login or through manual assignment—and the overall license capacity of the tenant. For example, the notation \"25/100 users\" indicates that 25 users have been allocated licenses, out of a total capacity of 100 licenses.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"License_usage_report\">License usage report</h2>\n<p>You can access an Excel report displaying the license usage for the current license at different times over the past month. Hover over the license icon and click the link in the tooltip to download the report.</p>\n<p>The report displays the actual number of users using this license and the total capacity of the license at specific times. The times are preset and the license information is automatically recorded according to the schedule that runs every 30 minutes. Note that the report records the number of users using this license at the end of the 30-minute interval, not the maximum number of users during that interval.</p>\n<h2 class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_topics\">Related topics</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/doc/423/26.1/userscontacts\" title=\"SMAX:25.1/UsersContacts\">Users and contacts</a></p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
