However, when you go to <strong>Build-&gt;Design-&gt;Service Designer-&gt;Image Aggregation </strong>in the agent portal to import an image, you see a \"Validation Failed\" error that resembles the following: </p>\n<p>  <a class=\"image\" href=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/0/07/SMAX_202305_IA_validation_error.png\" title=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/file/images/0/07/SMAX_202305_IA_validation_error.png\"> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/0/07/SMAX_202305_IA_validation_error.png\" height=\"316\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/SMAX_202305_IA_validation_error_2501aac5.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 316px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a></p>\n<p>After you click <strong>Skip Validation</strong>, you still see the following error message during the deployment of the offering:</p>\n<p><code>Error message: 'You have not accepted the legal terms on this subscription: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' for this plan. Before the subscription can be used, you need to accept the legal terms of the image. </code></p>\n<h2>Cause</h2>\n<p>When you skip validation, there's a chance that some offerings may not be deployed successfully if you haven't accepted their legal terms in the Azure portal. </p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Accept the legal terms in the Azure portal. Additionally, if programmatic deployment is disabled in the portal, enable it to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
