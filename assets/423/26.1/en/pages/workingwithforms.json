The specific form (or sometimes forms) shown to the user may depend on what phase of the workflow the records is currently in or what action the user is taking. It's not possible to create new forms. This restriction ensures a common look and behavior for all records of a certain type, leading to increased productivity for the end user as the fields are always in the same place for each record.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile Service Management doesn't allow the creation of new forms, there are several methods available to customize a form based on specific requirements. The two primary methods involve business rules and models.</p>\n<h2>Business Rules</h2>\n<p><br/>\nThere are several business rule templates available that allow modifications to a form based on defined conditions. Which rule to use depends on the type of change you are trying to make. These rules include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling a field</li>\n<li>Expanding a section</li>\n<li>Hiding a field</li>\n<li>Hiding a section</li>\n<li>Hiding a tab</li>\n<li>Restricting/allowing editing of fields</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>\nUsing the business rules, a common form can be modified based on criteria such as the current phase of the record, the model used, or any other information stored in the record itself. While there are too many examples of using the business rules to list here, the following represents some of the more common use cases.<br/>\n </p>\n<h3>Hiding sections based on phase</h3>\n<p>In the Change process, there is often different information needed at different times in the process. For example, there is specific information needed during the Review step of the process that's not meaningful for the earlier phases of the change. Here, the Hiding a section rule can be used to hide this information until needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ebdb5f9e6adc5.43126532.png\" title=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ebdb5f9e6adc5.43126532.png\"> <img alt=\"pn_image_5ebdb5f9e6adc5\" border=\"0\" height=\"173\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/pn_image_5ebdb5f9e6adc5.43126532_ac6b1c36.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 173px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a><br/>\n<br/>\nNote that a separate rule is used for the preview, full, and the calendar preview forms. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce this rule is in place, the Review section isn't visible in the early phases of the change:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ebdb5fa6b9a41.64951574.png\" title=\"/file/images/pn_images/pn_image_5ebdb5fa6b9a41.64951574.png\"> <img alt=\"pn_image_5ebdb5fa6b9a41\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/d/d0/WorkingwithForms_2_new.png\" height=\"347\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/pn_image_5ebdb5fa6b9a41.64951574_bf5ae30d.png\" style=\"width:799px;height:347px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"799\"/> </a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it is visible for Changes that have reached the Review phase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/file/images/6/65/pn_image_5ebdb5fad73fa6.70494213_new.png\" title=\"/file/images/6/65/pn_image_5ebdb5fad73fa6.70494213_new.png\"> <img alt=\"pn_image_5ebdb5fad73fa6\" border=\"0\" file=\"https://staging.docs.microfocus.com/mediawiki/images/6/65/pn_image_5ebdb5fad73fa6.70494213_new.png\" height=\"472\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"../../../images/pn_image_5ebdb5fad73fa6.70494213_new_018fcd37.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 472px; margin: 0px; border: 0px solid black;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"800\"/> </a><br/>\n </p>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p></div>",
