As a result of organizations moving towards digitization, and the way in which users engage with technology and services in non-work contexts, there has been a shift in how employees and IT work together. However, this new synergy brings requirements that a classically deployed, stable legacy service management architecture cannot easily meet. As your organization considers a digital transformation strategy that will enable it to operate with greater ease, efficiency, productivity, and overall agility, and to keep users happy and engaged, your IT service management processes must adopt these modern capabilities. We will help you achieve that when transitioning to Service Management. This documentation will focus on the evolution process when coming from the Service Manager, but the approach is general enough that with small modifications it can be used for any existing service management ",

Can I use machine types other than those specified in the sizing guide? No. One VM with 8vCPU can have better performance than 2 VMs with 4vCPU in some scenarios. VMs have their own limitations, so you can't improve system performance simply by adding more VMs. Additionally, all our sizing recommendations, tuning and tests are based on certain requirements for each node. You can't guarantee the performance if using VMs that don't meet the requirements for a node. Can I share storage between development and test environments? Technically, you can.

Can I use machine types other than those specified in the sizing guide? No. One VM with 8vCPU can have better performance than 2 VMs with 4vCPU in some scenarios. VMs have their own limitations, so you can't improve system performance simply by adding more VMs. Additionally, all our sizing recommendations, tuning and tests are based on certain requirements for each node. You can't guarantee the performance if using VMs that don't meet the requirements for a node. Can I share storage between development and test environments? Technically, you can. However, we don't recommend it. This is because all our sizing recommendations, tuning and tests are based on an assumption that each environment uses their dedicated storage. Sharing the same storage between two environments may cause the environments to i",

With Native SACM enabled, the enhanced CI aging feature enables you to manage the lifecycle of CIs. If Universal Discovery hasn't discovered a CI for a predefined period of time, the system sets its discovery state to Purgeable in UD/UCMDB rather than auto-purges it in the traditional way. You can then retire the purgeable CI either manually or automatically via workflows. For example, you can configure the CI workflow in the agent interface so CIs can be retired and moved to the End of Life metaphase automatically. Likewise, if a CI is provisioned by a Service Design through the DND integration, the CI will be created in UCMDB and then synchronized to Service Management. At this point, the provision state field is set to Provisioned, which indicates its active connection with DND. Later when it enters the end of its lifecycle, the provision state will be set to Purgeable. How to en",

The expressions can be of the following types: A logical expression (&&, ||, ==, !=) A mathematical expression (+, -, /, *) A conditional expression (if-else) An object property (Objects) A function call (DSL functions) You can define complex expressions by combining these types of expressions. Every value which is not a Boolean, number or string is an expression. Note The Integration Studio configuration UI supports the Unicode character set.

Note If you have customized content, don't run the automatic synchronization, which will overwrite your customized content. When a new version of the custom mode adapter is published, you must manually merge the updated content of the new adapter with your customized content and then run the custom synchronization only.

To enable Service Management to connect to the external PostgreSQL server through SSL, you must import the PostgreSQL CA certificate into Service Management. This can be done either during or after the suite installation. This topic describes how to enable PostgreSQL SSL connections after the suite installation. Additionally, this topic also describes how to replace the PostgreSQL CA certificate file in the suite. Notes: This operation might cause system downtime. Perform this operation in a planned maintenance window. If the PostgreSQL server certificate is about to expire or is no longer valid, you need to replace it with another new certificate on the database server side. If the CA certificate chain of the new certificate is the same as the CA certificate chain of the old certificate, no action is required on the Service Management side",

This is an example of the approval plan applying to a particular offering: It specifies that the request requires the approval of the manager of the requestor.

Therefore, the information in the submitted request is incorrect. The user logs in to the Service Portal, goes to the request tracking page, and corrects the information about the operating system. Assuming Service Management is configured appropriately, the request assignee then receives notification that the user has made a change to the request.

The following sections discuss some of the practical considerations and techniques. Duration and calculated fields Let’s assume you want to know how long change records stay in the Plan phase. To find this out, you create a calculated field using the Phase duration template, and selecting the Plan phase. You call the calculated field Duration of Plan phase. Having created the calculated field, you then create a report displaying changes, and using this field. It's likely the report will include a number of changes for which the Duration of Plan phase is zero. What does that mean? The possible explanations for Duration of Plan phase being zero are as follows: The change record never was in the Plan phase. The change record is still in the Plan phase.

Service Management lists related records in a separate tab on the change form. The Related records tab enables you to review, create, and delete relationships among Service Management records. The bracketed number in the tab label displays the number of related records for the current record. There are three types of related records: Causes of the record are other changes, incidents, or problems that triggered the current record. Example: an employee requests a certain change to an email account. The request triggered an incident because there is an email server outage. You can't complete the change until the incident status is closed. Effects of the record are other changes, incidents, or problems that are the result of the current record. Example: the incident to repair the email server outage gener",

The analysis considers questions asked by the Service Portal users, as well as search strings that were entered by the users. It also analyzes how users treated the search results that were generated, that is, which search results were further drilled into, and so on. The hot topic maps provide an analysis of important interest areas that have arisen through the Service Portal. For more information, see How to analyze Service Portal knowledge searches. From the analytics that are displayed, you can in turn create knowledge articles based on the results generated, providing a more directed source of information for future user searches. You can also create offerings based on Service Portal user activity you see here. Note To use Hot Topic Analytics, you must hav",

    "content": "If Native SACM is enabled, the enhanced CI aging feature enables you to manage the lifecycle of CIs. If Universal Discovery hasn't discovered a CI for a predefined period of time, the system sets its discovery state to Purgeable in UD/UCMDB rather than auto-purges it in the traditional way. Accordingly, the CI's missing flag will be automatically set and one email notification will be sent to the CI owner for confirmation, the owner can then decide if he/she needs to retire the purgeable CI either manually or automatically through workflows. Likewise, if a CI is provisioned by a Service Design through the DND integration, the CI will be created in UCMDB and then synchronized to Service Management. At this point, the provision state field is set to Provisioned, which indicates that it is provisioned by DND. Later when it is decommissioned by DND, the provision state will be set to Purgeable. Then, for Devices and System Elements, the CI will be automatically moved to the Retired or Ende",

In the filter above the map, you can't select any other record types as it defaults to Incidents, but you can select a service type as a secondary filter using the Add filter button .

The fields in the created problem are populated by the information only from the first incident selected. All other incidents become the new problem's related links. When",

Step 1: Parse job parameters The SAM job executor parses parameters in the job context record, such as the product you want to calculate and the data source you want to use. SAM automatically generates these job parameters based on your operations on the UI. Step 2: Fetch license data SAM retrieves license data based on the parsed parameters and uses the retrieved data to build an in-memory license pool. Step 3: Fetch CI data from UD/UCMDB Based on the parsed parameters, SAM retrieves CI data from UD/UCMDB through an API. Step 4: Organize CI and configuration data SAM organizes the retrieved CI data by calculation unit, and then passes the organized CI and configuration data as input context.

A visual flow debugger makes it easy to debug flows. OO Workflow Designer doesn’t require a connection to Central. All of its repository operations are available offline. If a source control interaction is required, you decide when the interaction occurs.

In the Expression Editor, enter the python expression to manipulate the output value.

You can construct expressions that return a string value using records and properties. For example, the expression ${entity.Type} returns the type of the current record and ${entity.PhaseId} returns the current phase of the current record. A property with a value of type Enum is a string value. For example, if the Urgency field is defined as an Enum type field, the expression ${entity.Urgency} returns the value of the Urgency field of the current record as a string. Note The DisplayLabel property of an Enum value type field returns the localized label based on the current user locale. For example, the expression ${entity.Urgency.DisplayLabel} returns the value of the Urgency field of t",

    "content": "The smart virtual agent fails to match the intent if the characters in training sentences are similar-looking in different languages. Cause The NLU models are trained based on different languages. Therefore, for one intent, if user defines Japanese and Chinese as languages for training sentences, the virtual agent will have one model for Japanese and one for Chinese. When interacting with the virtual agent, it needs to identify the language of input, and then use the corresponding model to identify the intent. But the language detection function may not always be accurate, especially when dealing with similar-looking languages, such as Chinese and Japanese which have words in common. For example, the input \"自宅住所\" could be Chinese words or Japanese kanji. Perform the following steps to determine the issue: After the portal user sends the input, open the sanic_access.log file under nlu log folder (for example, /var/vols/itom/itsma/logging-volume/va/nlu/) Check if there is any log as \"POS",

    "content": "In UCMDB, each federated CI type (such as BusinessService, InfrastructureService, BusinessApplication, and Node) comes with default identification rules to prevent the duplication of key attributes (e.g., name) among different CIs. However, by default, Service Management doesn't have this restriction when creating new CIs, this may cause potential conflicts when data is synchronized with UCMDB through Native SACM. Although UCMDB eventually rejects such creations and flags errors for duplicated CIs, it's preferable to proactively validate and prevent such duplicates on the Service Management side. To achieve this, you can configure a validation business rule in Studio. For example, to ensure that no duplicated Actual Service with the same display label is created, you can add a validation rule within the \"After Change\" event, as shown below. If an attempt is made to create an Actual Service with a duplicated display label, the system will prompt an error window indicating the issue, as ",

    "contentLower": "in ucmdb, each federated ci type (such as businessservice, infrastructureservice, businessapplication, and node) comes with default identification rules to prevent the duplication of key attributes (e.g., name) among different cis. however, by default, service management doesn't have this restriction when creating new cis, this may cause potential conflicts when data is synchronized with ucmdb through native sacm. although ucmdb eventually rejects such creations and flags errors for duplicated cis, it's preferable to proactively validate and prevent such duplicates on the service management side. to achieve this, you can configure a validation business rule in studio. for example, to ensure that no duplicated actual service with the same display label is created, you can add a validation rule within the \"after change\" event, as shown below. if an attempt is made to create an actual service with a duplicated display label, the system will prompt an error window indicating the issue, as ",

Each flow should have a single, well-focused purpose, executing one single aspect of the desired functionality. Also, the name of flow must be self-explanatory. Modular flows are: Easier to create. Separate more responsibilities into separate flows? Because each responsibility is an axis to change. When the requirements change, that change alters the responsibility of the flows. If a flow has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. This kind of coupling leads to fragile designs that break in unexpected ways when changed. Easier to test.
